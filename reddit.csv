unpopularopinion,StayDoomsdaySleepy,Celebrity charity is bullshit," tbh, not really. How much of an impact can someone make by themselves? What's needed is mass change and reform. That said, it is nice to see celebs step up and lead by example. If nothing else it increases awareness. Are you talking about welfare? I'm assuming you are, since, within the context of celeb dono's, money is usually given to *the poor* through some form of welfare, not given entirely to a lottery winner.

unpopularopinion,DanceJessicaDance,Sign language should be a requirement in high school.," Spanish 1 and 2 were mandatory and I don't remember anything from those classes (well, I don't remember most things they taught in school but, I digress). I agree with an option, but mandatory.... bruh... nobody's selfish for not wanting to learn sign language. Its just another language. Are people who don't want to learn Korean selfish too? or Italian? Let people learn what they want. Its unfortunate that people are deaf (I personally would go insane if I went deaf and I'm not even exaggerating) but I wouldn't look down on someone just because they didn't want to learn the language. Im not mad at any foreigner who doesn't know english so... A more important option would be to fund medical science programs that would put research into options for deaf people to hear."

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," Im pretty sure when they say ""niche"" they're talking thematically, not in terms of gameplay. When you're building a world run primarily by humans, you have way more creative freedom to create interesting HUMAN characters than you do making interesting non-human characters. A world whose history is told from the perspective of humans will have many cool human legends to explore and flesh out, as well as just cool human stuff always going on. For example, really cool/famous but ultimately normal humans (i.e. Draven, MF, Quinn, Ekko) can expand the world a great deal without having to be all that special themselves. Creatures dont fit into that model the same way. For a creature in such a world to be interesting enough to warrant so much attention, they not only probably need to be sentient (which writes out a great deal already) but they'd usually have to be something way more significant, unique, ""niche."" Think about it; of the ""creature"" champs we have, we have gods and demi-gods, ascended warriors, harbingers of calamity, apocalyptic demons, ancient beasts. More often than not they fit into those ""massively important"" categories, and they usually establish or build upon legends in some way, with like Rammus and Yuumi probably being lamer than most (though Im p sure Rammus is a meme in Runeterra). They have to go to much greater lengths to make an interesting creature than an interesting human basically, so their roles in the story are niche."

The group seems to be specifically for AMWF tho, so that's not really surprising. He also added that he also preferred Latinas and Arabs and nothing about that site was pro Asian because he did make it clear that Asian women don't care about Asian men so there's no need for them to preserve Asian actual outside of Asia, which actually makes sense.

Feminism,UniquePaperclip,Congratulations. Kamala Harris is now officially the first ever female Vice President of the United States.," I'm sorry I'm not asking for purity, and never did I say that we shouldnt vote for Biden or anything like that but in the long run we're going to have to face the fact that at the end of the day Biden and Kamala have little to no interest in curbing US imperialism, or radically changing many of the racist institutions this country is predicated on. Sure they might make incremental change, they may actually make quantifiable social change but they arent truly interested in altering the system which enables these injustices. It doesnt take a pure person not to war monger, but Biden did cause he still profits from US imperialism"
Feminism,UniquePaperclip,Congratulations.

Speaking as an educator in a district where housing, income, jobs, and truancy are all go hand in hand, I see the root of this law, or at least I'd like to, as being inherently good. Are there instances where bad things happen, no matter the good intention? Yes. Does that make me perhaps a bit of an idealist? Maybe.  Seeing as she was a DA at the time, I believe that Harris and the others worked to achieve thier goals through the means they had available, the criminal justice system. I absolutely do not believe that the crimal justice system is the correct approach for that end result, but I also believe a lot of our criminal justice funds and resources could be redistributed to systems and programs that work to problem solve, not penalize, so we don't have to take it to courts and jails when unnecessary. I also realize that I have made decisions that didn't work as I planned for them to. I don't expect anyone to make perfect decisions as we are all imperfect. Its also important that this decision was not made unilaterally. She was apparently crucial to pressing the issue, but it took many to make it happen.  It takes time and patience to develop and employ any system that works and even more time and effort to continually improve it.  Thanks again for bringing this issue to my attention. It does affect the way I see some of her policies, though I still think she's a kick-ass speaker. I'm gonna cut myself off here cause I feel like I'm rambling. Peace."

In WMAF couples, the guy often (not always though) has an internalized Asian fetish of sorts, and the girl has a white fetish (especially common in Asian American girls, as they've been exposed to white beauty standards growing up and this becomes their ideal man). This is why you see a lot of guys from WMAF relationships on the hapas sub: because neither parent views Asian men that highly, yet that's essentially what their son is going to be viewed as by most people. With AMWF couples, the guy is almost always Westernized/Americanized, often to the point of being a conservative Republican and nativist. He also tends to be an Asian tiger parent, which usually puts him at odds with his white Western wife. All of this, as you might guess, doesn't always go well for the mixed race children they have. All of this is anecdotal experience though, and not everything applies to every couple."

If you lean right you‚Äôll be fed videos of leftist intolerance and police hatred - if you lean left you‚Äôll see videos of police brutality and hate speech from the right. I travelled America for 3 months just before Donald Trump was first elected and I found that most of his supporters were reasoned people and spoke honestly and openly about why they were voting for him. If I go on Facebook all I see is extremists.  My point is most of us are good and want the best for each other.

I haven't seen commenters bringing up Joe Biden's creepiness towards and sniffing of women, the sexual assault allegation against Biden, Hunter Biden's can of shitty worms, Biden's mistakes in Anita Hill's testimony, Biden voting   to protect busing to achieve segregation, and all his other mistakes as much as commenters have been bringing up the negative past of Harris (in their respective posts). Is this our own internalized misogyny? Is it internalized racism? Help me understand. No woman or man is perfect. I am not glossing over her mistakes. I want her to do better. But these comments illustrate how women, especially women of color, are held to higher standards than men or even white women  . When she is acting VP, I will be vocal about her policies and statements. I also know I won't agree with her every political move. But for now I want to celebrate and feel good about the first freaking African and Asian American woman winning the position as VP. I actually   that she is not perfect. I do not expect her to be. But her representation is culturally and socially significant to American young women and girls. It is a step forward to making women in power  . I would rather have imperfect women‚Äì yes, even conservative, female republicans‚Äì in politics than no women at all."

unpopularopinion,Kiemons,Eco friendly does nothing to help the environment or barley.," As an environmentalist, being eco-friendly in fact saves money. Most things are not difficult at all and are in fact easier than the alternative, wasteful lifestyle choices. And sure, to actually make a widespread difference, most of the population has to do it. But does that mean we shouldn't do it even when many aren't? No. Because every step taken, no matter how small, to become more environmentally conscious means less waste polluting the planet."

unpopularopinion,michael_saw,Failure doesn't hurt as much as the success of your friends.," Definitely an unpopular opinion lol  For what it's worth, I do think jealousy is normal and we all resent the success of our friends from time to time. Success, after all, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's a relative thing, and if your friends are more successful than you, then you are relatively a failure. At the end of the day, we aren't much better than a bunch of crabs in a bucket.  That said, what you are describing is pretty extreme. Failing a test would feel much worse than my friend getting a good grade. For the most part, I can be happy for people. Especially if they are people I love.

unpopularopinion,DanceJessicaDance,Sign language should be a requirement in high school.," The issue is that there is resistance among deaf communities about this. Hearing people largely think about this issue based only their own feelings about being able to communicate with the deaf and their own conception of what it means to be deaf, without really asking deaf people what shifts would be most impactful for them. One of the primary concerns is the connection between language and culture. It has been shown in studies that language impacts the way we view the world and our perspective on various issues. Sign language is no different - deaf communities have developed their own sub-culture which is created, reinforced, and reproduced through language. If this language was opened up to hearing communities, hearing communities would inevitably hijack and co-opt sign language due to the fact that they have much larger numbers. As a result, deaf people would be forced to conform to the language conventions of hearing people and may lose features of their culture.  These are similar concerns to the idea of universal languages (whether spoken or sign). Many people balk when they hear that there isn‚Äôt one universal sign language for deaf people but it is because they‚Äôre not fully considering relationship between language, culture, and society.  While I agree that it would be great to open up more communication between deaf and hearing communities, all attempts at finding solutions should put deaf people in the driver‚Äôs seat."

lgbt,Kelmo7,Hate has no place in this USA," Oh awesome! I also really liked the most recent episode in season 3 with the girl (but also canonically not entirely a girl?) named Adira who had a boyfriend (their word) from another species, and that boyfriend was very much gender ambiguous too. It was really cool to see it portrayed in that way, and it wasn't a plot point at all that the boyfriend (named Gray) was more or less ambiguously gendered which is even cooler. One thing I hate about a lot of ""woke"" media lately, a lot of which comes from very progressive writers even, is that they still feel the need to make the fact that someone is LGBTQ+ ""a thing"" rather than just telling me a story about people without constantly bringing up the fact that they're not straight. Like, I'll figure it out thanks, I don't need you to remind me that the main character is queer all the time when the plot doesn't really rely on that fact to function. Does that make sense? That's why I loved ST:D (awful initials lol) because they didn't feel the need to make a big statement about something that   be totally normalized to the point that it would be weird to bring it up."
lgbt,Kelmo7,Hate has no place in this USA," Theyre right though. The US has far more and far bigger problems than trump, and it has always blamed some minority for its problems.

atheism,TomLube,"As a Canadian, it's so fucking relieving to watch a President talk about following science.", I can hear Fox News now...
atheism,SailAwayAgain,The Toaster," I asked a similar question to a Rabbi once, and here is what he told me, his response sounds quite reasonable to me (although maybe it's just his personal opinion on the matter and not based on what it says in the texts precisely) So basically he compared this whole situation of having a free will with having a cat. So we, humans, are the cat and God is our owner. You set a certain rules for your cat what it must do, what it can't do etc, but at the same time you don't want to limit its will completely. So this kinda makes sense to me, having a certain design for you does not contradict your free will. With God knowing everything and everything is being predetermined I agree. I never asked this question, so yeah, this one seems strange to me. On the other hand, maybe (and this time it's just my personal guess again not based on the texts) the idea is that he sees all the possible scenarios (and there are several of them) but let's you choose freely which one you take? Either way it all seems like a game of Sims just for fun (why would someone choose to play in my life, that's a question still, it's boring as hell :D) What I personally don't get though, is this idea of resurection. In particular in Judaism (and I guess in Christianity at some point too, although probably not know) it is forbidden to damage your body (like tattoos, piercings, maybe other things, I don't know exactly) because they are to be eventually ressurected. Okay. I bet even the ancient people there noticed that corpses decomposed. So it said explicitly that the bodies will be restored. But if the bodies will have to be restored anyway, why does it matter what I do with my body now?"

It helped me deprograms the thinking I developed while living with an alcoholic but I think a regular support group for family of alcoholics would have helped just the same. Therapy is where a lot of the processing took place for me. In my opinion, NA, AA, al-anon, OEA--it's a disguised cult. You can benefit from some of the early and middle ""steps"" but they hinge on a Christianity-inspired conversion experience. There is an accumulated body of knowledge that may benefit you, if you can pick through the rot. By rot, I mean this idea that you're helpless and powerless without the ""power"" of a savior. Your ""savior"" can be ""God"" (or whatever gods you believe in, they assure you) or if you're not into supernatural characters, they will tell you it can be ""the Group."" You have to surrender your ego and admit you are powerless over the effects of addiction and codependency in your relationships and turn your life over to ""God"" or ""the Group."" How is this not a cult! I think it's shameful how this is pushed on people. It should be evidence-based and not based on prayers, slogans meant to replace critical thinking, and groupthink. You can even be mandated to attend by court. Imagine if courts started mandating people who've had nervous breakdowns attend a 12 step program founded by a hyper-religious Muslim.

leagueoflegends,Lounes524,Do trolls and inters actually get banned?," It's very difficult to get right. In theory, even someone who goes 0/20 and is reported in all their games, to Riot, it is plausible that this player is just absolutely terrible and actually trying, no matter how unlikely this is. This is why it's far easier to 'bypass' the banning by remaining 'incredibly optimistic and apologetic' in these games. Since this is always and permanently plausible, Riot cannot risk banning this player since in theory this player can rightfully say ""I got banned when I played my best/I was banned via honest gameplay"". That's why trolls/inters/feeders/griefers/whatever get so much leeway, because the plausibility that anyone who does terribly can just be 'playing honestly' will never be zero. This of course presents huge issues since it's so abusable. Put this alongside the whole ""it's okay to have bad games every now and then, we're only human"" only gives more room for these trolls/inters/whoever to get past being banned. Besides, it's in Riot's interests for all players to play for as long as possible as their money relies partially on how much players are exposed to cosmetics. On a bit of an unrelated topic, this is partially why consistently toxic players are easier to ban/punish regardless of their gameplay. Toxicity is far more unambiguous, gameplay plausibly can be entirely ambiguous."

unpopularopinion,StayDoomsdaySleepy,Celebrity charity is bullshit," Well, that's my point. The problem is deeper than the lack of food or place to live for some unfortunate people. And it cannot be solved by giving out food on streets, no matter how much of it. And giving out food is basically the same as giving out money, so you're contradicting yourself. You can't just throw poor people food and expect them to prosper. What I would expect from a person having the wealth, influence, connections & power who is really concerned with the problem (any problem, be it poverty & hunger, ecology, human rights, you name it) is leveraging all that to try and deal with the deepest root causes and put the most impact where it matters and solve the problem on bigger scale with much more efficiency. I'm talking about thing like building affordable (or free) housing for homeless, founding & financing law firms to help honest people in legal trouble (sometimes unfairly caused by corporate or government), lobbying & pushing every possible change that would help people to not lose jobs, to not lose homes, to not lose ability to provide for themselves and their families in the first place or regain the stable grounds in life when a disaster hits.

Other than that I had a constant workload which I tended to procrastinate. I treated studying as a full-time job and I worked out quite well. Looking back now, I'm amazed how little sleep I needed. Partying until 6 or 7 am, working a long shift at 11am. Pretty sure I just couldn't do it anymore. Most of my friends are now going to sleep at reasonable times, have a proper schedule. Back in the days those were the people who didn't sleep for three days straight. So I guess, students sleeping less is a true observation. But that's certainly not because of actually studying (except maybe certain short times during any given semester) and I don't think I've ever heard anyone boast about the fact how cool it is to not sleep enough.

ToxicAMWF,,Do you know any toxic AMWF couples IRL?, Ew!
ToxicAMWF,,Why don't AMWF shills just settle for undesirable fat/ugly WF?," Additionally, the fastest way to increase AMWF would be to confront white women about their anti-Asian bias but it seems most Asian men are too chickenshit to do that and would rather blame Asian women."
ToxicAMWF,,Why don't AMWF shills just settle for undesirable fat/ugly WF?," You remember the aznid crowdfunded AMWF porn? Also saw AMs praise a toothless white grandma as ""beautiful""  I think AMs think any skinny white blonde woman = attractive. Most AMs have zero interest in black/brown/dark skinned women which is evidence that they have been influenced by white beauty standards. I often see black woman bashing on Asian subs. Unattractive white women usually pair off with unattractive white men anyway. I can reliably count 2-3 AMWF couples every time I go out and I would say only 1 in 3 had a decent looking white woman. I've seen decent looking Asian men with seriously ugly/fat/weird white women. A good chunk of WMAF couples are transactional (mail order brides, military brides, gold diggers) so I don't automatically assume every WMAF are based on white worship/attraction from the AF. Many poor Asian women marry white men to escape poverty. I see a lot of ugly fat old white men walking around with their mail order brides in Australia. I pity them."

ToxicAMWF,AVWEFILAVWTIUTA,Do you know any toxic AMWF couples IRL?," I did, actually. The AM was a Chinese guy in his late 60s who actually tried to groom me when I was 15. He was at least 20 years older than his wife (I‚Äôd go with 30 years older) and he would often take her out ‚Äúfor a walk‚Äù in their Chinese community just to show her off. He met her when she was 15-16, too. The wife later got a restraining order against him for domestic violence and had him arrested. She also took their kids along with everything of value.

Feminism,UniquePaperclip,Congratulations. Kamala Harris is now officially the first ever female Vice President of the United States.," Congrats for her but personally... hmm. Remember when Klobuchar was considered a VP pick frontrunner until George Floyd got murdered by Minnesota cops and her career as a law and order prosecutor became a liability? I mean Kamala was also a CA attorney general with patchy records... There are some more charitable articles about her stance on racist policing mostly during her post-DA career but are the differences between her and other regular Democrats enough to warrant much expectation from her VP and possible presidential tenure from feminist, anti racist and progressive viewpoint other than being a sorta symbolic victory? US already had 8 years of Obama yet #BLM, #Occupy first came up during his presidency... Obv Im glad that rapist Trump and abortion hater Pence will be out of power for a while(after all the shitshow they are throwing now is defeated) but the next 4 years will also need a whole lot of fightin to acheive justice."
Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," Unfortunately, you pay for the mistakes of others. 
I'm a straight guy and obviously I find pretty women attractive, if they wear more revealing clothes off course it is going to catch my attention. It's not sexualization, it's just how nature works. You can't judge men for feeling attracted to you. Now, blatantly checking you out without any regard for your well-being is wrong. It's quite easy to know if the woman is feeling uncomfortable or not with the attention she's getting and it should be a no brainer to drop the thoughts after the 1st sign of rejection. Now, going back to the mistakes of others. I'm 24 years old and I'm already sick to my stomach of seemingly attractive girls who are completely empty shells. They have nothing besides their body, they bring nothing besides their looks. As a human being, everyone relates what is familiar so if they see you and your appearance being quite similar to these woman I've described, they will associate and initially treat you like you also have that ""label"". The same way you'd run from me if I looked like a psychopath and approached you, even if my intent was to give you something you dropped on the floor behind you. It's not wrong, it's just a human being's instinct of self protection. Now, feminism is not my fight. I'm not interested in arguing what's right or wrong. I just hope you can relate to my opinion and maybe work on what you can improve on your end to be perceived as smart, educated and confident, rather than a ""sexualized"" person. This way, maybe the ones approaching you would be men interested in getting to know you and not men who'd much rather skip all that and sweat under the sheets. Remember, not wanting unwanted attention is part of living. I've been approached by women I don't fancy, by homossexual men, in some cases I even felt insulted that I was being approached in that way. I understand what you feel but they did nothing wrong by approaching me as long as they were respectful, didn't invade my personal space and accepted the rejection without a fuss."
Feminism,UniquePaperclip,Congratulations. Kamala Harris is now officially the first ever female Vice President of the United States., Unfortunately not official. With the current Supreme Court I won‚Äôt breath assured until the Inauguration Day. Although I really hope with will become official.

lgbt,kid-do,Pronouns don‚Äôt equal Gender ?," pronouns don‚Äôt equal gender in the same way that clothes, makeup, and stereotypical gender roles dont equal gender. they can be indicative of gender, but they don‚Äôt have to match up. many people‚Äôs complex relationships to gender result in them identifying as a man, but preferring she/her pronouns, or vice versa for women and he/him (this happens regardless of whether someone is trans or cis, and regardless of sexuality). additionally, many nonbinary people, such as myself, only use typically gendered pronouns (he/him for me), and even more use typically gendered pronouns along with other pronouns (she/they, he/they, etc). this doesn‚Äôt inherently invalidate trans people, and binary trans people are totally valid in choosing the pronouns that traditionally align with their gender. hope this helps!"

Conservative,huckingfoes,Discussion: AP Calls Election for Biden," You‚Äôve really drank the fake narrative kool aid. DJT is the strongest GOP candidate in 3 decades and the approval polls are as fake as the public opinion polls turned out to be.  Biden should not have won this (and he didn‚Äôt without fraud.) He faced a massive enthusiasm gap and had a divided party behind him based on the primaries. Both of these are better predictors than public opinion polling. He had no ground game and he barely even ran a campaign. The covid crisis benefited him greatly but he would never have made it over the finish line without these Democrat Machines in Urban areas.  DJT outperformed 2016 in every urban area except 4, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Detroit. The writing is in the wall and this is slowly starting to be unraveled."
Conservative,akiseXyukki,Joe Biden wins the election 2020," I agree with you on that.  Whenever this talking point is hyped up, I try to not buy the hype too much. Fossil fuels are responsible for the tires on our cars, heating our houses, cooling our houses and a million other things I won‚Äôt even get into. Sure, if we start a transition to clean energy it does spell trouble for the future but I truly believe energy companies have enough capital and resources to adjust in the future and still end up on top. Who else is better equipped to innovate? Regarding the sector, yes some will die out - but that is inevitable in the   of our wonderful country. Sidebar: Natural gas is also a fossil fuel but it and its derivatives (NGLs, LNG, LPG and their components) have entirely different dynamics and a much more promising future than crude oil which is conflated with other petroleum products. Natural gas currently fuels 38.4% of power generation in the US and as coal falls further into disuse that percentage will increase. We export natural gas by pipeline to Mexico in increasing amounts. The very low price of natural gas enables it to be liquified, shipped to Asia and then regassified competitively with gas from Australia and Qatar. While there were some shipping cancellations at the height of the virus shutdown (at the cost of the intended recipients ) it is anticipated that shipments will again resume as intended. NGLs-- when transformed from ethane to ethylene and then polyethylene and propane to propylene and then polypropylene and butane to isobutane--are the bases of billions of dollars annually of industrial, medical, commercial and other products. LPG exports to underdeveloped countries is growing. And of course, natural gas provides heating and air conditioning in their respective seasons. Just my two pence though. Thank you for the civil discussion."

ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,Would you ever date a male bananarang?," Nope, never have and never will."
ToxicAMWF,,Would you ever date a male bananarang?, Do you date WF?
ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,Would you ever date a male bananarang?," Actually, it was mainly brown/native-passing ""Hispanics"" who said these sort of things. Very few ""Latinos"" in the neighborhood I live in are white-passing."
ToxicAMWF,,Would you ever date a male bananarang?, Mejorar la raza. Ewww. Are mostly-white Hispanics arrogant and do they act like they're better than brown/native-passing Hispanics?
ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,Would you ever date a male bananarang?," Well, this sub seems to be the only place where white-worshipping by Asians ( ) is discussed in full detail. I have witnessed this phenomenon in my ""Latino"" community irl. One particular occurrence I remember was listening to a trio of Hispanic siblings ( ) bragging about how they got themselves white partners and how their kids will turn out ""lighter-skinned"" and ""better-looking"". Looking back at the some of the things that ""Hispanics"" have said about white people, makes my stomach turn sometimes."
ToxicAMWF,,Would you ever date a male bananarang?," Yes. There are several prominent bananarangs on Asian subs like Cyberchimera. lol and they have the nerve to bash Asian women who date out. Fair enough.  I thought you were a woman, what motivates you to post in toxicamwf? You don't exactly have a dog in this fight.

ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,Disillusioned with aznid," Actually, they   right in saying that they have to date out and go with WF due to a lot of AF preferring WM. In their minds, since many AF are dating WM, they feel as though that they have to do the same thing as well. I myself blame Asians ( ) for being such Lus and Chans. LMFAO, this sub has PLENTY of evidence proving that AMWF is not that different from WMAF. Definitely, if STPeach was black or ""Latina"" ( ,  ), Chans wouldn't even give a   of admiration or acclaim for her and her AM husband. They   give a bit more if she were Asian, but since she is white, that is all that is needed for them to slobber over her. Absolutely pathetic and cringe-worthy if you ask me."

Feminism,peterparkinsons22,Feminist view on single mothers," You might find more interesting perspectives if you read about the more general problem of unpaid care work performed by women. The reason there are more single mothers than single fathers is that women are pressured to take on care work when it's needed. So women are less likely to leave their child, and more likely to care for the child alone when it's needed. But they're also more likely to be the one to care for their elderly parents or stay with their partner when they're sick."

This is just straight dismissal of feelings combined with a bit of condescension and some naturalistic fallacy. Also throw in some ignorance, as if people never masturbated before the advent of porn. Basically, misogyny. As opposed to gas lighting which would be telling her that her bf never masturbated and she was confused. We are trying to stay away from outrage porn so won‚Äôt be approved."

Trump tweeted that my city should be ""invaded."" At this point we already knew he's full of shit but it was very jarring to see the violent rhetoric spewed at a city most conservatives don't ever bother visiting because they think it is a ""liberal hellhole"" or something and not our home. It was uncomfortable living in an American city so unlike what Trump and his media clique described it as. I was getting texts and calls from concerned relatives asking me if ""antifa"" was going to hurt me. God. Then there were the convoys of trucks coming into towns just to fight? Political violence combined with a leader famous for vicious and reckless rhetoric does not lead to a stress free life. But you can rest easy.

The cases will naturally decline in March-May, because the warmer months DO suppress the spread of the virus. The problem was always the expectation it would decline to near negligible levels, which was unrealistic. It's a novel virus. It'll still have higher than your average flu/cold transmission, even in the summer months. When it started to blow up in March, things were already starting to get less favorable for transmission.

Conservative,akiseXyukki,Joe Biden wins the election 2020," Mitch McConnell is essentially a fig leaf for the Republican senators in less secure states. A lightning rod that the Left can focus all their attention on to keep senators that would actually be at risk of losing their seats out of the spotlight. He doesn't bring bills to the floor so that people like Susan Collins don't need to publicly vote no against something that her electorate may want. It's a pretty transparent sham, because the Senate majority leader is not a constitutional position and the Senate could change the rules about how it works at any time with a simple majority if it, say, wanted to vote on something that he doesn't let through to the floor. But looking at the Senate election results in battleground states it still seems to work well enough."

atheism,Wild_Kindheartedness,"Back to holding my position as an atheist, and this time I'm in the Strong Atheism category. [Warning - This post is a bit deep so I would advise against reading this if you are new to this subreddit]"," Personally I dont think this is what sets us apart from animals, though. I think communication does. Language is like what the internet is to computers. It networks all our ideas, and allows us to accumulate and pass knowledge down to the next generation. I think many mammals probably conceptualize to a similar extent that we do, but they just don't have a way of sharing it or developing their ideas over many generations. Intelligence isn't something that evolved overnight. Its taken millions of years. Long before humans existed.  Even language has been evolving for more than 3 million years in hominins. There's a gene colloquially referred to as the language gene that's required for us to form language. And mutations in this gene result in language deficits. However comparative gene analysis shows that this gene is fully intact in Neanderthals, suggesting that they were capable of language with a comparable degree of complexity to us, and it's even present in our common ancestor, homo erectus. Although its not fully intact at that point. Interestingly a more primitive variant of this gene is present in other euarchontaglires, like mice. And has been implicated in singing, crying, laughing and feeling ticklish, which mice are capable of. This suggests that this gene has been involved in the evolution of prosocial behavior before primates diverged from rodents between 60-90 million years ago.  In fact, I actually don't think intelligence is a random trait at all in humans. Once upon a time it was thought that evolution occurred in tiny spurts with a lot of change occurring in short amounts of time with gaps in between filled with a whole lot of nothing. But the more we study the fossil record, the more we find that evolution has actually been pretty continuous. Brain volume has been steadily increasing since the first vertebrate brain evolved in tunicates before the Cambrian explosion more than 600 million years ago. Hemichordates, a sister lineage of chordates (the ancestors of vertebrates) actually have a nerve fiber that goes from the tip of their tail to the tip of their nose. A lot of our lower brain anatomy is conserved in fish, like the amygdala and the hippocampus, the centers of fear and memory. The reward system began evolving in reptiles, and adrenaline as we know it only evolved in the first mammals, although many reptiles have similar analogues. At that point mammals were already prosocial and cared for their young. Most of the difference in brain volume between reptiles and mammals is actually olfactory and motor sensory. So basically our sense of smell as well as our dermis evolving into a specialized sensory organ. And as far as I'm concerned, emotions as we know them are for the large part conserved across mammals. And are equally as complex, albeit differently complex in birds. Over time mammal brains developed more specialized cerebrums while birds developed their palliums. And like mammals, birds also have very complex methods of communication. Which I have a theory on that too. Birds, bats, primates, and even koalas have managed to transition to environments where there is limited risk from predators. Creating an opportunity to develop complex social structures and mating habits. And other than the major brain differences between reptile, birds and mammals, (birds actually have about 2.5 times the neuron density that mammals do, which is in line with the selective pressures imposed on flighted animals to be light weight. So pretty much every anatomical feature is more compact and lighter in birds. And corvids like crows and magpies have about as many neurons as small primates. But other than that brain size is pretty strongly correlated to body mass. More overall cells, more brain cells. So the evolution of humans was somewhat inevitable. In fact, I often wonder how many intelligent species lived on earth before the massive megafauna extinction began 50,000 years ago as humans spread outward from Africa. Giant sloths and Saber tooth cats were huge. There was even a bear that made polar bears look like teddy bears that was known to prey on humans. These animals were probably remarkable intelligent. But then humans wiped out pretty much everything that was bigger than us outside of Africa. Elephants being one of the few remaining megafauna left from that era, and are remarkably intelligent. Today humans appear to be an anomaly, but the world we live in since the evolution of humans is very different than the world 50,000 years ago. So, no thanks to humans, the world we love in today isn't really representative of the one we evolved in. If humans hadn't evolved I have no doubt that another mammal, maybe not even a primate, would be filling our ecological niche. Bears are also insanely intelligent and occupy a similar niche that we did."

1. God decides who the nations ""leaders"" are
2. The just pray for God's kingdom to come, through whomever is in power
3. God will use the nations ""leaders"" to bring about His will (don't fear for anything)

If someone stole from the Irishman, he could petition the police and courts.  If someone harmed the Irishman, he could sue for damages.

While I myself ( ) also believe that the majority of WMAF is bad/toxic, there is a minority of that pairing who is non-toxic/healthy/good. I apply the same thing to AMWF as well. Since there is such a stigma surrounding WMAF being non-healthy ( ), it is best for AF to go after BM, ""L""M ( ), MENAM, IM or better yet the men of their own race, AM. In order to balance things out, AM must also go after WOC (BF, ""L""F, MENAF, IF) or just stick with their own, AF. In what fucking world is this Chan living in?

Feminism,JessFluoresce,"""Prehistoric female hunter discovery upends gender role assumptions"" - it has been officially proven (finally!!)."," The absurd amount of evidence you are referring to has been shaken by this new discovery. Like I already mentioned, they say that evidence AGAINST this assumption has been dismissed. There has been a lot of evidence against it - as the article states. Researchers have often dismissed it. That is one of the points of the article. Repeating ""there has been evidence for gender division"" is missing the point. Yes, the claim has been that nearly all hunters have been male. The 80% you are referring to is a number you just made up as far as anyone can tell. 80% would also be enough to say that it was ""divided between sexes, although dominantly male"" or something like that,   ""hunterers were male"", which suggests a near exclusivity. The article is based on a  . You can't expect to see good sex-segregated research in those times. Like we already established, most of the time evidence to the contrary was dismissed. Which, just as a side note, is not specific to the historical field but has been observed in many, many scientific fields even in current times. Again, one of the points of this article was that the assumption that hunters are male was so ""commonsensical"" to researchers that they didn't even bother to find out if it was true - and if they had hints or evidence to the contrary, they have been dismissed. And I repeat again, this is not surprising as these things STILL happen in scientific fields, even in the medical field to this day. And yes, it focuses on one part of history (like your example above that is not only from 1998 but also focuses only on one specific example but somehow that doesn't seem to bother you there). That's where it begins. You can expect that this find will have impact on some other researchers that will take the sex of the remains in consideration from now on. You are battling an imaginary point. I never made that point. It's simple: This finding has cast doubt on the assumption that all hunters are male. It casts doubt on previous research where evidence was not collected on the sexes of the remains and on the research where evidence was dismissed. It shows that further research specifically on the sex of hunters and gatherers will be beneficial to understand the roles in these times.
That's pretty much all that this article is saying. It's hard to understand what exactly could be discussed about it. Also, you still haven't linked me the paper that you were referring to. Would appreciate it."

Just as we have a plethora of evidence for the prevalence of ""man the hunter"" and ""woman the gatherer"" roles.  The claim was never that literally all hunters are male, even if 80% of hunters were male it would still be a strongly gendered activity.  Assuming that a hunter was male because hunters were overwhelmingly male does not mean they believe women never hunted. You represented their opinion as being: ""It was pretty much 'only men hunted'."" We have many other reasons to believe that hunters were predominantly male for other reasons. Like atlatl's being mostly buried with men, as that article mentioned.  Or noting that hunters tended to be male in recorded observations of hunter gatherers, as well as agrarians that supplemented their crops with hunted meat(like the   for instance).  And once again, it focuses on one period in human history where the atlatl and javelin predominated. The authors themselves admit that this specific form of technology is more conducive to women hunting for a number of reasons.

The article says: or this in the same article: And it was so drastic, that this was the researchers thoughts when they saw the remains of a female (unknown at that time) hunter: Also I see that the quote you gave earlier was actually in my favor and not in yours: Which means that the simple division in male / female was shaky not necessarily the new research.

It needed researchers like these that were ready to challenge their beliefs to find out that actually 11 out of the 27 were female. Also: And here also: And do you see that this is exactly what is happening here? If it would have been men with these tools you would have readily assumed that these were hunters without doubt.

I would have partially agreed if it would have been only 1 or 2 identified females or 11 out of the hundreds. But it's not. It's 11 out of 27, that is a lot.

I've tried a WHOLE lot of stuff for PBE, unfortunately there are quite a few bugs that are affecting the whole playstyle of jungle yorick so it needs to be bugfixed for the best experience. Sunderer is good, but I can't see the reason to go sunderer over goredrinker. For the reduced damage to towers, you gain an almost tiamat active effect to push the wave faster and the sustain via the active effect is just insane. I'm predicting a side-split maiden build where you can split her ASAP once teamfights begin, and then you can group Yorick with Sterak's Gage/Goredrinker and play the middle of the fights. Never die becasue of the sustain, and while you're doing it, maiden is pushing bot lane. Unfortunately Trinity feels absolutely weak now, so i'm not sure what we'll do without that as our cookie cutter build. It will take a LONG time to test it all out, and don't even get me started on jungle changes either. Right now Yorick doesn't use majority of the items that SHOULD work via pets, so when they're bug fixed, we get access to a strong version of Cleaver/Ravenous Hydra/Muramana/Red Smite etc. There's also a bug right now where pets are taking extra damage in the jungle, they're supposed to only take 50% vs monsters but they're taking 75% instead.

Just as some Christians truly believe beyond any doubt that God exists, I truly believe he doesn't. That is for me what Strong Atheism means. I'm convinced that there is NOT A GOD.  I could define God as a being with a personality and wants and desires. OR I could define GOD as an infinite intellgience working beyond all things. Let me start with the first version of 'God', one with a character. A personality. -----Scientists mostly agree that the universe began with a big bang. Correct? So why would I believe that a singularity, a point with zero dimensions, a mathematical object that cannot be defined, and is essentially nothingness in the truest sense of the word, could be created by a being that is more complex, more defined and has human qualities?  So onto the second version of God I defined, which would be the God of pure mystery and infinite power, with what we could call 'beyond all comprehension. Here, the argument for the existence of God breaks down, because if we are talking about a God that is identical to what we define as an object that can't be defined, but that expanded outward in a Big Bang and gave rise to electrons, planets, and us humans, then there is no line to draw between the definition of that kind of God and the definition of the singularity/quantum vacuum."

ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,WOKE Redditor tells ChanIdentity that AMWF is NOT woke. Mods lock the comments and white-fever Chans downvote it heavily.," I'm going to have to disagree with him on this one. Such couples usually involve the White woman being the mail order bride as well as AM sexpats taking advantage of Eastern European women of low socioeconomic status.  Same thing here with the AMs more likely to be sexpats in non-Western countries. There are even AMs in Africa who marry local women primarily for economic purposes, or they abandon the African woman after impregnating her with Blasian Hapa children.  I actually think being with WOC from the West is more progressive as Western WOC, knowing what it is like to grow up in a country as minorities, are far more woke about racism than WOC who were raised in countries where their race is the majority.

First off, this post proves that when AFs like to said they prefer WMs because they are more ""masculine"", that that statement is  . The number-one reason they like to go with them (the majority of the time) is because of  . Chans like to said that AF are ""brainwashed"" by Hollywood to find WMs ""attractive"" and ""manly"", while AMs are given the opposite treatment. If that were the case, we would   that the majority of WMAF couples would consist of a top-tier WM (basically handsome and wealthy) and maybe a top-tier AF. Instead, the exact   has happened. Feel free to provide your own insights on this social topic. I will crosspost this in  Masculinity. Wish me luck :) Edit:  Masculinity ISN'T letting me crosspost. I will continue to crosspost until I get a reply from these Chans. Edit 2: They replied to me and have said that they only accept copy/paste links to posts, not crossposts. Edit 3: I did copy/paste just like these Chans said and when I logged out, I found that my post was REMOVED. I have already sent them another pm. If they decide to ban me from there, I'll happily accept it as a badge of honor from these dumbfucks. Edit 4:   This is a pm one of the ChanMasculinity mods sent me about   my post is not going through. Can anyone help me figure out whether the stuff he is saying is true or he just doesn't want me to post on his sub?"

ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,"It still baffles me that Chans say Asia is ""Matriarchal"" when videos like this showcase a COMPLETELY different reality."," LOL much of Asia is patriarchal (anyone recall Confucian values/hierarchical family expectations?). I can't speak for all of Asia, but I do know that I went to the US to South Korea to work there and the male director/supervisor/employee kept commenting on my appearance. Not my clothing--but attractiveness and then after the physical touching (keeping a hand on my back), I just couldn't stand it. There are few female jobs there. If anything ""mental health issues"" occur when you are not getting enough societal support. I wouldn't be surprised if there's another side to the aznidentity story, but I wouldn't expect the toxic posters on that sub to be curious about it (although I wouldn't dismiss everyone there). It's pretty typical of them to highlight some random story and use it to bash Asian women."

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," The only real solution is for women to get more REAL power. Political power. So constantly be thinking about and encouraging the women and girls in your sphere to run for public office.  Have   considered running for elected office? I guarantee that you are better qualified and would be more successful than many elected men. At the very least, there is a marked reduction in the probability that you would harass or assault women.  Its also far more likely that you would be driven to serve your electorate rather than just use the position for your own personal  ambition."
Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem, That's Haram though
Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," I actually had this discussion with my mom a while ago. She got angry for a bit but I managed to convince her. Or, well, she seemingly already agreed with me, but wanted to protect me. So I told her that the only way she can really protect me is to do what she can to help contribute to a society for newer generations where we don't even have to protect ourselves from possible predators. The problem isn't us, it's them. I've never been cat-called despite wearing skirts, but nevertheless I get furious when I hear about people who have been harassed or even sexually abused like that. Not to make it all about me or anything, apologies. I just thought I'd share a bit of my experience."

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. Wear whatever you want. I was 11 wearing unicorn clothing and bows from Claire‚Äôs in the 6th grade; clearly a child. Did that stop the men from starting at me provocatively? Looking under my skirt when I was foolishly, innocently sitting wrong at the bus stop? It wasn‚Äôt my fault the bus took so long and I had become numb from being in the same position so long. I just wanted comfort and had a bad approach. The men wanted more than comfort when they were looking at me. It‚Äôs some years later and I dress a bit more adult. In my freshman year now. I wear heels, I wear shapely clothing a little more. I wear more makeup and just like being feminine. This factor increases in me year by year lol. Did any of that stop the street harassment? No, definitely not. In fact I got my first catcall a few months back (before it was just being followed, starred at or some provocative look). Some guy was singing some song to me. Beauty is suggestive. Someone‚Äôs always seeing you as attractive; and sadly some people have no filter. Catcalling, rape, whatever it may be...they‚Äôre all power moves. The outfit doesn‚Äôt matter so you may as well wear what you please. Im sure you look lovely no matter the outfit!"

Feminism,JessFluoresce,"""Prehistoric female hunter discovery upends gender role assumptions"" - it has been officially proven (finally!!)."," There are/were hunter/gatherer societies where women hunt and fight, and some of these societies have been know for a while. And even in the examples of hunter/gatherer societies that I have seen where there is a division of labor where men do the hunting, women gather herbs, roots, fruits, etc, so even in these cases the idea that men are the providers is ridiculous. In fact, I have never heard of a single example of a hunter/gatherer society where women just stayed around the camp while men provided for resources. And we must also consider that the division of people into  the men/women binary were/are not even present  in many indigenous societies. In fact, we can never tell how societies classified the gender of a given person just by looking at their skeletons if we know nothing about the culture of these societies. There are also societies where men take a very important role in taking care of small children such as the Aka:  "" According to the data he began collecting more than two decades ago, Aka fathers are within reach of their infants 47% of the time - that's apparently more than fathers in any other cultural group on the planet, which is why Fathers Direct has decided to dub the Aka ""the best dads in the world"". "" One especially riveting facet of Aka life is that women are not only just as likely as their men to hunt, but are even sometimes more proficient as hunters. Hitherto, it has usually been assumed that, because of women's role as gestators and carers of the young, hunting was historically a universally male preserve: but in one study Hewlett found a woman who hunted through the eighth month of her pregnancy and was back at work with her nets and her spears just a month after giving birth. Other mothers went hunting with their newborns strapped to their sides, despite the fact that their prey, the duiker (a type of antelope), can be a dangerous beast. "" That being said, there is still some degree of hierarchy between men and women between the Aka, but they are an example that challenge some stereotypes about gender roles."

And since it's all subjective, you have no way to show them to be wrong. And let's not forget what your argument was. You in fact spoke of the embryo as a person when you explained that they don't have a right to use another person's body. I know it's a trap of language and all but again, this is because it's a  . I don't see the distinction. If you are expected to physically do something then that's the use of your body. Could you examine your reasoning here? If laws against neglect exist, doesn't that negate consent? This laws ARE violating a person's will and body in that they mandate actions. Under the law, a parent's care for their child is mandated whether they ""consent"" or not.

Conservative,akiseXyukki,Joe Biden wins the election 2020, Dude there wasl literally a week long range spiral when Obama wore a tan suit.  The flagrant hypocrisy shown is insane. You guys are predictable as hell but its still shocking
Conservative,huckingfoes,Discussion: AP Calls Election for Biden," Biden should have won this easy. Going into election day everyone was sure Biden would win, a blue wave. Then the news anchors kept getting surprised all night. They started talking about their own polls being wrong and were amazed at Trump‚Äôs level of support. Then we get to the closest Presidential race in all of US history. We have 6 states won by less than 1%- many of them less than .5%. We have claims of fraud and cheating in an election where more ballots were mailed in than ever before.
It looks like Biden won- and that‚Äôs great. I congratulate Joe Biden, this has been his life long ambition. I honestly wish him the best I hope he does a great job. So the Democrats go the big prize- the prize they wanted so badly for 4 years. They were able to oust Donald Trump. But it wasn‚Äôt as big of a victory as it seems. First, it appears as though the GOP will maintain control over the Senate. This spells trouble for Biden. It‚Äôs hard to increase taxes without the Senate You cannot expand the court or pack the court meaning the Supreme Court stays in the hands of the GOP Democratic legislation can be blocked. This means any actions Biden takes will likely have to be done via executive order meaning it can all be easily overturned.
Thus Biden may be able to make small immediate changes but they will be temporary. Secondly, the GOP won in state legislators.
This sounds unimportant but it is not. We have some re-districting on the horizon and the GOP will get to draw the districts. Both parties want to be in control as districts are drawn. By drawing districts, you can get yourself a massive advantage politically.
This means the GOP will have the advantage in the HOR for years to come- something that will come up in 2022, 2024, 2026, and even 2030. Thirdly the GOP made BIG gains on the ground.
The GOP gained ground with black voters and latino voters- both crucial to the growth of the party.
Think about this- the GOP made gains with minorities with DONALD TRUMP- a man who has been called racist every day for 4 years. Imagine what the GOP could do with a candidate a little more relaxed and not so nativist.
This new populist wave of the GOP isn‚Äôt dead- it‚Äôs stronger than ever. Last the intangible.
I remember in 2016 I became worried about the GOP. Then as 2017, 2018, and 2019 came I worried far more.
I used to be rather liberal and remember arguing with the many Republicans that hated Obama. Even then I never imagined how much a President could be hated.
The level of hatred Democrats had for Trump is quite frankly insane. They literally can hardly say the man's name. He is an orange lord and his supporters are MAGAots. Every person I spoke with had their own childish nickname for Trump. It was a whole new thing.
This hatred inspired a shift further left in the Democratic party as well as a single-minded desire to win. This led to a massive turnout.
The GOP will no we fueled by perceived fraud. To them, the Democrats tried to overturn the 2016 election for 4 years and when that failed they cheated to get Trump out of office. They feel suppressed and angry.
They will mobilize and resist every bit as much as Democrats did.
The Democrats ran the safest candidate they had against a historically unpopular President in the worst year of the last 2 decades and they barely won.
What if the Democrats run someone less safe? What if Biden dies or gets sick and it‚Äôs Harris at the helm in 2024? We now have more swing states than ever and this means closer more volatile elections."

They obstructed Obama's appointments to purposefully leave empty seats and then packed the courts full of partisan judges. Even the supreme court wasn't off limits. So now Democrats are bad for trying to get their fair share of representation? Those judges are supposed to be impartial but clearly they are now political tools. We all may have wanted impartial judges but now there's absolutely no denying that the Republican party does not believe courts should be impartial. They believe courts should be conservative.

If the election really does end up getting flipped in the courts then these same low-info media slaves will burn down their own cities (which I'm okay with. Let them riot and let the cops beat their faces in if it comes down to it). If all is said and done and Trump lost fairly then whatever. Who fucking cares. Leftists however are currently acting like fraud is not only impossible, but that Democrats wouldn't even attempt it. It's patently absurd. The process isn't over until it's actually over.

ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,Divorce Statistics Regarding Interracial Couples," Well I think that WMAF couples tend to stay more longer, due to many AF in those marriages doing everything they can (including playing up the ""submissive"" and ""feminine"" part of what AF are supposed to be like) in order to please their WM husband, and the WM husband doesn't see anything wrong with that and is satisfied that his ""oriental fantasy"" is going as plan. AMWF have WW in those relationships who are more ""feminist"" and ""independent"" (according to WM) and sometimes AM will not be able to put up with those demands of their white wives. Both pairings have (majority of the time, but not all the time) self-hating Asian partners and white partners who do not really see the struggles or perspectives their Asian partners tend to deal with in White-majority countries. As for black-white pairings, I tend to view BMWF as ""woke"" and standing against white supremacy/nationalism,   I'm recently starting to think whether it is actually ""woke"". Because like you said in where  I view WMBF in good terms as well (although there are a couple of self-haters in that pairing as well *Example: Candace Owens and this BF who posted   on 4chan:  )."

ToxicAMWF,omarsoto1970,Divorce Statistics Regarding Interracial Couples," I haven't really looked into interracial statistics myself so I'm not too sure how reliable they can be, but I'll assume that these findings are accurate for the sake of discussion.  A couple staying married does not necessarily mean they have a happy and healthy marriage or that they want to stay together. WMAF has been more common for longer compared to AMWF, so the WMAF sample is likely to be older than the AMWF sample overall. And, iirc, older generations tend to hold a stigma towards divorce and single parents and/or that divorce was much more difficult for women back in the day. AMWF couples in the West tend to be ones where the Asian spouse is Westernized, as is the female spouse. I predict that WMAF divorce rates will increase as the WMAF population sees an increase in cases where the AF is 2nd+ generation Asian-American, and as overall divorce rates increase in Asia with ""modernization"", as well (both AMAF and interracial divorce is expected to increase).  BMWF has been one of the most common interracial pairing since interracial marriages was legalized in the U.S. It is also likely that a lot of the BM in the relationship chose a WW out of a fetish, which explains why such marriages don't work out. I'm not too sure about WMBF. Perhaps-as I've heard-Black women tend to prefer Black men while White men would have other options if they don't want/can't find White women, so that might mean that if the WM and BW choose each other it is because they genuinely love each other as individuals.  What do you think?"

But I'm sure that AMs would still complain about WMAF even if they were to have easy access to WFs, as men in general do tend to feel entitled to women of their own race even if they don't want the AW (think Black men who mostly/only go after non-Black women but still get mad at Black women who date out)."

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," Being attractive is not a huge ask for women, there is a culture of attractiveness that is not at all preached on men; guys are just not taught or policed about looking good unlike most women, its kind of the opposite, you are taught to look gruff since looking good or being pleasant is somehow effeminate.

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," You notice too I'd say before the 90s so many famous rockstars dated underage girls?

She said too which I notice a lot of people say about underage dating back then ""it was different times back then"".  The woman too seemed to be kind of coming to the realisation that it was wrong for Jimmy Page to have dated her but she didn't see herself as a victim of sexual assault when technically that's what it was. I can imagine it's really hard to see someone you were in a relationship with who you loved to be an abuser. No one wants to see themselves as a victim"

Feminism,babyyjourno,This changed my whole view of feminism.," Like others have said most, if not all, women struggle with internalised misogyny to some extent because they have been brought up in the environment where that is acceptable. I really struggle with it as I grew up in a women dominated family that would laugh at my uncle's misogynistic ""jokes"" like there were nothing and, while I felt uncomfortable with them, I laughed too. It's only years later and further down the road of feminism that I have realised that this wasn't ok. While he thought he was being funny the jokes he made weren't at all. They encouraged the attitude that women should be in kitchen's, men are better, women are weak, etc. And the compliments he would give me weren't the compliments that one should be giving their niece (again he said these in front of everyone and no one said anything). He would joke that I was a ""tart"" in front of everyone including my parents and because no one did anything I thought that behaviour was ok. The only time I was told about something was when my mum and gran pulled me to the side because they deemed I was too old to be sitting on his knee (tbf I was a little too old but I didn't know it was wrong, to me it was just something I had done since I was a toddler). Internalised misogyny is so hard to navigate because half the time you don't realise you've internalised something until years later and by then the possible damage is already done. One of the good things about recognising it though is that you can now work to change things (I shut my uncle down as politely and calmly as possible, even when he's trying to get a rise out of me), and to raise awareness so that other people will recognise it in their own lives."
Feminism,BuchoTheSecond,What are feminists thoughts on Kamala possibly becoming first female president.," Disclaimer: Not a US citizen, and actually have a female head of state, Chancellor Merkel.   Honestly, the   she got there isn't as important as what she   with it. As long as she got there legally and does a great job, she will normalize women, women of colour, and women who worked their way up, in the highest positions of the US government. And the society of the US desperately needs that.  The US being led by a woman like her will send a strong signal around the world  that women have a place in leading positions, a stronger signal than many other women in places that get less attention in world media have sent. A woman's place is at home? Yeah, at the head of state's home. As head of state. So really... I hope she becomes president eventually. Maybe in a year, maybe in 8."

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem, There was a thread about what‚Äôs different as someone who grew up in the 80s and 90s. Adult men leering at children was a thing.

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," First I would like a clarification from Riot what really is considered a creature. Do they mean anything with non-humanoid anatomy? Literally anything that is not a human? You mention champions like Thresh and Aatrox in your post as creatures, but I am not really sure if that is how Riot counts these. They mention that they would have went for another creature champion this year if the voting made them rework Shyvana and in my opinion, Shyvana is as much non-human as Aatrox. So I think your analysis has some flaws here. I think Riot is not considering some champions as creatures which you are accounting here. Personally, I am satisfied with them stating that they will release at least 1 new creature champion every year. I gravitate more towards human champions myself, even if I still play quite alot of creatures. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ I just thought of another example why Riot might consider creatures more niche, btw. With Rek'Sai's release, they were going for a risk by going with the monster theme to the max. Unlike all the other void creatures, Rek'Sai  . They removed literally the only human feature all the other void creatures had, speech, and were looking at how people received her design. For many people, being able to relate to a champion seems important. Rek'Sai was not really relatable, she just comes across as a mindless beast that just kills. Sure, there might be people who enjoy that niche, but it is still just that, a narrow niche. I think Rek'Sai might have been one of the turning point that made Riot consider that creature champions are too niche to focus on. And she might also be the reason why all our creature champions are getting humanized quite alot now."

ToxicAMWF,,"Eurasian Tiger ""talked' to Elliot Rodger the night before the massacre (shocking proof)"," Hey, it's not my fault he got doxxed because I wasn't the one who leaked his face on the internet and even then I had offered to take responsibility and help him and he didn't want it. If you ask me, his problem is his failed marriage that was never based in actual chemistry, passion and love. Gratitude isn't love and there is no way you can create great art by rationalizing like ""oh she is not intellectual and wears the same clothes for a week and is disgusted to touch my cock, but she was there for me and I have to convince myself that this is it"". Such a woman can never be your muse and ET is a liar. He always says ""I love art above everything"" yet he chooses a life that makes any art creation impossible and instead results in him being mediocre, bald and fat.
There is no virtue in avoidance. But anyway, his failed existence is not my problem, we all know he is too pussified to ever reach out to me or apologize. He would never call his wife sewer rat, but I will make sure everyone knows that she is a filthy, materialistic WMAF sewer rat and so is he.

Someone who really could legitimately take toxic WMAF all the way to the mainstream can't even handle his own affairs properly, and now makes himself look like a deranged instigator of unfortunate events. It's unfortunate, but if he kept himself anonymous, there would be an air of haughty righteousness and mystery about him that would've carried him through to achieve his goals of publicizing the backwardness of WMAF. Sadly, he messed himself up at the last minute, and now there's this mess coming out about him. This is just plain sad.

Feminism,BuchoTheSecond,What are feminists thoughts on Kamala possibly becoming first female president., I can only hope she stays on her best behavior and doesn't flip so readily on issues as she did when she was a lawyer.
Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," I think the jeans and hoodie part is essential. The ""what was she wearing"" question is completely inappropriate and simply ignores the fact that no matter how women dress they still get unwanted attention. Even speaking up and saying no is not enough. How often do women have to say ""I have a boyfriend"" before someone accepts to take no for an answer? Because the prior claim of some other man has more value than the choice and opinion of the woman he's trying to ""seduce"". I think what's to blame is the perception of women in society.  The fact is most societies are patriarchal and put the burden of responsibility on women for something they have no control over instead of teaching men that women are their equals and should be respected as such. If you don't want to be treated like a piece of meat what makes you think anyone else wants it? What really shocks me is having conversations with men explaining that no, unlike their belief, most women do not dress for attention and just dress for themselves. Yet at the end of the conversation they still believe 100% it is to attract them. Women in their point of view are products who exist to serve and satisfy them.  As long as we don't teach respect and equality in all its forms it will be difficult to change this. Not to mention most major religions also teach that women are there to please, serve, obey... Tldr: wear what you want to wear, you'll get unwanted attention either way. Only idiots would believe the length of your clothing determines what kind of person you are or your value as a human being."

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," It genuinely breaks my heart to read things like this, no matter how many times I come across it, no matter how well ingrained into my head it is that this is a universal for women all across the world. You should never have to feel like that, ever. No one should. The most important thing is that you stay safe while we all continue to challenge these social norms. I hope you feel that you can dress how you want if it makes you happy, but consider weighing up how it might make you feel to potentially receive extra attention. You should live your life without being a slave to fear of male behaviour, but - and not to overstep my boundaries - please be safe. I wanted to try and write a supportive, helpful message but I think it‚Äôs all come out wrong. I‚Äôm sorry about that. I hope you have an amazing life."
Feminism,JessFluoresce,"""Prehistoric female hunter discovery upends gender role assumptions"" - it has been officially proven (finally!!)."," Yes, you're right. To move away from fixed gender roles we definitely need to start using non-binary words more, otherwise we're just as bad as we're also focusing on the fixed gender roles even if it's just to disagree with them (still very important though). Ultimately, we need to adopt these new non-binary descriptors to be inclusive to all and to finally step away from gender roles altogether. That way there's no stigma, judgement or prejudice. Then people can just be people, being whoever they want, doing whatever they want (as long as it's not hurting themselves or others of course)."

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," It‚Äôs sad that women are being conditioned to completely cover our entire body, but when men wear tank tops and shorts no one bats an eye! It is very sad and we should live in a world where we can wear whatever we want, wear flowy skirts and crop tops and go out at night time without feeling like there‚Äôs a predator looking for you, in reality women do not have the freedom we are said that we have, we still have so many limitations based on the dangers of perverted men."

Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," I completely get this! It's the most frustrating thing ever. I've grown up in a patriarchal society where literally men gawk at women all the time. From a very young age I got so used to men/boy staring at me and me feeling absolutely uncomfortable with it. It's been so long I can literally tell if someone if staring at me from some direction, it's pathetic. I used to think I love big tshirts and not caring about clothes or fashion or showing my fem side a lot but I've recently come to realise that all of that was largely shaped by how I grew up feeling uncomfortable and with people making me feel weird for being in my own skin, you know? Even now if I wear something that shoes of skin not considered apt culturally where I am I feel the need to constantly reassure myself that it's okay, do I really wanna wear it etc. Very recently I've decided to firmly enjoy my fem side and fully embrace my body even for the uncomfortable/insecure bits. It's tough but I'm getting there."
Feminism,crowdedbrain,The pervert problem," Well I used to dress like that at your age and I was not aware enough to notice leering. I never considered that people hit on me on the street /public transit because my appearance was not only attractive but made me appear (Based on their preconceptions) like I had the kind of personality Which would make me open to this. Now though, Covid time, men have gotten brazen. I started getting random gross comments ‚Äúcomplimenting‚Äù me Plus some staring in the elevator even though I Actually dress Modestly. I feel more comfortable dressing modestly, which is an idea which would have never occurred to me if I hadn‚Äôt met my bf who is from a Muslim country. When I‚Äôm more covered up I don‚Äôt have an issue staring back and asking ‚ÄúWHAT?‚Äù So they would turn their head away (only after excessive staring.) there are sadly a lot of perverts out there and I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúgive‚Äù them anything to ‚Äúwork with‚Äù lol. Also modest (Neck down covered up, not ‚Äújust pants‚Äù or Just skirts without leggings) dressing made me not compare my look with other women at work and generally more focused on what matters. I don‚Äôt think this is the answer you were looking for but I had a really positive experience with this change even though in the beginning it was just something silly I don‚Äôt mind doing to please my bf as he does lots to please me too."

And the pandemic will be raging by the time Biden gets in to begin trying to bring it under control, while at the same time battling the naysayers and deniers who will fight him on every measure he tries to implement to fix it.  My thoughts are Trump will lose his court challenges, then he either just does nothing until January 20th but golfing and sulking, or he actively tries to leave as big a mess as he can on the way out.

I'm a straight dude, but I've been supporting this community since 2004 when I was a freshman in high school and our school's GSA showed me that not everyone was hetero and that it's absolutely okay, and to see our society get from that point where calling people f4gs as an insult was considered acceptable even in media to where we are now with major plotlines in globally popular series treating homosexuality as such a normal thing that not a single character views it any differently than every other relationship...

leagueoflegends,AutoModerator,Monday Megathread! Ask questions and share knowledge; newcomer questions encouraged!," As an ADC main I can assure you that the role is probably one of the most frustrating to get into as a new player for about 2 seasons now. But with that said...  The role doesn‚Äôt have that much champion diversity, for the most part the champion pool happens to perform very similar tasks so I will outline the ones that are beginner friendly and better tailored for new players.  Caitlyn, Miss Fortune, Ezreal, Ashe, and Jinx are very good picks to start with. They‚Äôre all rather simple and don‚Äôt require too much to make them work out. Jinx and Ezreal are probably the most difficult of the bunch but for reasons I‚Äôll explain shortly. Caitlyn - She‚Äôs a very strong laner with her absurd range and ability to deal a lot of damage. She has some utility in her kit with her W cc that acts as both a root and a damage amplifier, and a tiny bit of mobility with her E that can help her reposition in some sticky situations. The most fun part of her kit however happen to be her passive, her Q, and her ultimate. She‚Äôs a hell of a sniper, literally, and it shows in her kit. Her passive gives her extra damage on every 7th auto attack (this can be shortened by attacking from bushes) or when the enemy is hit by your W or E (this also gives extra range). Her Q is a skill shot that deals a lot of damage and has very long range. Her ultimate is what is probably her most iconic ability, she can lock on to a target from a very long distance and snipe them. Good for executing a target that flashed away given you still have vision.  Miss Fortune - She‚Äôs a lane bully that excels at short burst trades and poking the enemy out of lane. Her passive makes her first auto attack on a target deal extra damage, her Q is a single target ability that can bounce to a target behind the initial one and deals bonus damage to the enemy behind if it kills the first target (it‚Äôs important to set up enemy minions to be executed by your Q to deal massive damage as it also applies your passive). Her W gives her passive movement speed and can be activated to give bonus attack speed. And her E is a slowing field. Her ultimate is really strong in team fights as it‚Äôs a massive AoE cone that deals a lot of damage to all enemies inside it for its duration.  Ezreal - Very mobile champion who scales extraordinarily well into the mid game (but is somewhat weak early and late). His safety is what makes him a good early ADC to pick up. His passive is hard to effectively use as a new player so I won‚Äôt go over it, but his Q is a skill shot that applies on hit effects (his bread and butter) and lowers his ability cooldowns by 1.5 seconds if it lands. His W is a skill shot that marks a target (epic monsters, towers and champions) and it can be detonated by his Q, E or an auto attack to deal bonus damage. His E is an extra flash. No I‚Äôm not joking. And his ultimate is a global skill shot with massive width.  Ashe - Good utility ADC with passive slow and the ability to stun with her ultimate. She deals extra damage to targets she slows with her auto attacks or W. her Q is an attack speed steroid and applies extra auto attacks (on hit effects do not apply multiple times but life steal does, unfortunately so does thornmail so careful). Her W is a long range damaging ability that fires in a cone. Her E is a global ability that reveals things in its path (good to scout enemy jungler or mid roams). Her ultimate is just a very useful global stun. She is easy to pick up, but also can be difficult to master (look up Gen G Ruler kiting on Ashe) Jinx - Hypercarry. Her passive gives her mobility on champion or turret takedown. Her Q either gives her stacking attack speed or allows her to increase her range and fire rockets that deal bonus damage (at the cost of mana per shot). Her W is a skill shot that slows. Her E is a set of three traps that can root enemies. Her ultimate is a global skill shot that executes (the lower their HP the more dmg it deals).  As it stands, Jinx is likely to be the most frustrating to play because of her lack of mobility whereas Ezreal is probably the most mechanically demanding of the bunch. This can make them difficult pickups even if they‚Äôre rather new player friendly.  I must reiterate however that the role is very frustrating to play because of its high dependency on gold and correct itemization. This is to say that a 1/3 Jax with 1 item can still demolish you with 3 items if you do not position correctly or don‚Äôt have sufficient peel. It‚Äôs important to focus on farming as a skill for the role. Otherwise it‚Äôs also very fun because it‚Äôs a role that has a lot of potential for mechanical expression.  Good luck"

For example my sister when she was in elementary school or sth wrote a story about how a Viking settlement was attacked while all the men were away and the women and girls fought back and defeated the attackers. Stuff like that. Many of those scenarios seemed much more realistic than what we were told. Of course it makes sense if women can at least defend themselves in a time when they could be attacked easily. Of course it makes sense that instead of idk gathering fucking berries all day the women and girls that weren‚Äôt needed for stuff like caring for the kids would go join the hunting. Those are just general practical considerations."
Feminism,JessFluoresce,"""Prehistoric female hunter discovery upends gender role assumptions"" - it has been officially proven (finally!!)."," Although I would rebel at even the mapping of hunter to maleness, even on a spectrum. We need new descriptors of a person's natural or instinctive behaviours that eliminate the binary.  E.g. boisterous, competitive, sporty, enjoyment of  physical stress, eyesight, hand eye coordination.  These might be predictors of being keen to join the hunt and I know plenty of women, extremely feminine women, who revel in competition and challenges. And plenty of men who prefer to watch.  So you are right, it's not even slightly weird :-)"

Feminism,babyyjourno,This changed my whole view of feminism.," Unfortunately, most women struggle with internalized misogyny because we are raised with these beliefs for generations. It becomes a part of us and feels like normal opinions or thoughts. I blamed myself for years after being sexually assaulted at 15. It didn't help to see others blame me or other survivors, so I thought I was right to blame myself. Now that I look back, it seems so strange that I beat myself up for certain things but uplifted others for having the same experiences. I still struggle with internalized misogyny when it comes to body image."

Feminism,BuchoTheSecond,What are feminists thoughts on Kamala possibly becoming first female president.," I think it's a best case scenario and I don't even like her.  We need to see women in positions of power. I say that knowing she will be measured by ""male"" yardsticks and any failure she has will be magnified tenfold.  I don't love her, but if she biffs, does that speak poorly of female leadership? Hell no. What is notable is Trump has failed to do almost anything he said he would do, letting down his entire voter base) and half the country still backed him up this week. Why support such a slug? He's a dude. We need women to be in the same role, failing or not, so we can see that the position is truly equal opportunity. And even as much as I'm lukewarm on her personally, I think she will do a MUCH better job than Trump. Or Biden. Women have a long history of having to overperform to make it at all, and she's no different. These men have been handed just about everything.   Having a woman elected direct to Presidency is of course preferable, but let's remember...we are electing her as part of the ticket. The VPs job is to take over if needed. She's half the package here. For many ""Biden"" voters, she's the appeal.  However, to do due diligence to my feelings here...I would have really struggled with Sarah Palin becoming President instead of Obama. So it's not ""just"" about getting a woman in charge. Had she been running with McCain as VP, I wouldn't have been remotely swayed towards getting a woman into office. Politics and values still matter here. I'm real unstoked on ACB nomination.  So it's not just about lifting up women‚Äîyou have to be strategic too. But within reason, I would lean towards the female option and even sacrifice some alignment with a male candidate just to boost representation. In fact, I did vote Bernie in the primary."

They also went on to say that kids from XMBF couples end up ""ghetto/hood"" because no black woman can ever be a good mother according to them. Although from what I've observed it's actually the opposite, as in; BMWF/BMXF tends to be a fetish especially if it's with a WF, the BM is self hating and hates black women, and usually the WF/XF thinks she's a prize above BF. On the other hand, WMBF is rare since black women are the least white worshipping and would even chose other men of color before choosing a white man. These guys obsessively fantasize about dating white women, sometimes lighter skinned mixed black women and other non-black/non-dark WOC.

We've had exchanges about this before, but it's like we've said, only opting to date white women while ignoring black and other POC women is like buying stock from Blockbuster while Netflix is on the rise (and continues to be so). Times have changed a lot, and the cultural environment is especially different today compared to the cultural environment that a lot of these Asian men grew up in when they were young. With increased demographic changes in the United States, an entire advertising/media industry trying to save itself by finally representing and marketing to POC's and an entire political party that is increasingly devoted towards representing the interests of POC's, non-white women can only increase in desirability, eventually allowing them to be on par with white women in terms of their competitiveness and desirability in the dating market. In the future, just having a white woman on your arm is not enough - if she's not objectively desirable, nobody's going to be envying her and especially not the non-white guy who's with her. We are definitely making way towards a day when an objectively beautiful, top-notch WOC getting passed along for an average white woman is over. In the future, the only competition for beautiful, high-quality WOC's will be beautiful, high-quality WF's, while average and below-average WF's should expect to compete on the same level as average and below-average WOC's and come nowhere near the same level of competitiveness as beautiful, high-quality WOC's.  A lot of these guys are trying to make up for all of the bullshit they've faced in childhood, that's understandable. However, their internalization of that racist hierarchy for their own status-hungry motives will cost them heavily. High-quality people from all races are not going to look at their average-looking Becky and think that they've won a prize. They will be more likely to envy the man with a beautiful, high-quality WOC than they will with an average/below average-looking WF. The best these guys can expect is for people to look at them with a patronizing/pitying attitude. They have nothing to brag or feel proud about."

unpopularopinion,-momi,"The steoreotype of ""student running on four hours of sleep and a package of instant ramen"" is not cool and damaging to student mental health"," I get why you're upset by some of their comments. Some of it is a little presumptuous. For example, the first year is easier in many ways when it comes to course load because the higher level courses are harder. Depending on what someone is studying, their own academic prowess, health issues, what year they're in, what other responsibilities they have, how many hours they're taking, etc., they might have a far harder course load than the next person. So, even if one person is having an easy time, it doesn't mean everyone is. I live in the U.S., but I had an honest to God mental & physical breakdown in college. The stress of college wasn't the main issue, but it helped contribute to my breakdown. The course load- particularly because I had OCD (overdid everything as a result), & took summer courses & more than fulltime classes (older student trying to rush graduation)- probably helped push me over the edge. My professor told me long before my breakdown that he'd had multiple students who had legitimate breakdowns in his class, including full blown psychosis.   Plus, my friend literally didn't have money for food, so I had to buy hers & mine both with loan $ & what I worked out on campus tutoring other students. Ramen isn't healthy all the time, & I hate how wasteful the packaging is, but I know why people eat it. It's cheap, it's quick if you're in a rush, & you don't need a stove to make it.   With that said, I didn't get triggered by the OP because I get what they're saying, & some of it is spot on. For example, some people do complain about trivial crap & take their good position for granted while disregarding others' struggles. And the college lifestyle is unhealthy as crap.

[Warning - This post is a bit deep so I would advise against reading this if you are new to this subreddit]"," Yes. I think the important point to remember is that while Christianity paints humans as the crown of creation, nothing about evolution and the theory of natural selection points to us being special in sense of being the most flexible, evolved or superior species among all other organisms with which we share the planet While humans have been very successful at spreading and multiplying, and seemingly becoming a kind of apex predator with guns and helicopters, walls and buildings, thats the same thing as any other extended phenotype that a species uses to protect itself. A human being may be wired up to be able to conceptualise death in a way no other animal can. The fact that humans can be truly self-aware of their achievements, memories and emotional bonds being utterly destroyed by the death of their brain and body may have had a biological use, or it may have been a 'mistake', a direction that the evolution of the genus HOMO, took. You could call it an 'experiment by nature' but it could just be something that, while fun at times, is actually going to wipe out our species at some point. You used a better phrase. 'selective pressure'."
atheism,Heinzelboss,About Bidens speech: Why is America so religion-centered?," I'm not American, and I also was a little surprised to find out how much religion matters in secular society. But I think in a lot of cases it's just a matter of cultural belief. Like many people celebrate Christmas cause it's fun and not all of them put a religious meaning into it, right? As for his choice of words, maybe he was talking it from himself, if I'm not mistaken he's a Catholic, so it would be pretty natural for him to say it. Plus it's probably one of those figures of speech that nobody really considers that religious anymore (like saying ""bless you"" when somebody sneezes) Also I find it quite problematic to include atheists here ""God bless you all... But if you don't believe in god, then..."" What exactly? :D On the other hand, I have this feeling (I hope Americans will correct me if I'm wrong) that no matter what it is steal the default and hence expected that a person belongs to some religion. At least nominally. When I read about American politicians on Wikipedia, all of them have some religion listed. Obviously I can't get into their minds to see how much they believe and know what they practice, but the fact itself. How many American politicians are there who are openly atheists? Could it be that there is a certain glass ceiling if you don't belong to any religion?"

Conservative,Sartevscamus,PA Judge Orders Provisional Ballots from Individuals Who ALREADY Voted are Set Aside.," The legislature passes the laws that control elections.  The courts simply apply the law to a set of facts to answer a legal questions. SCOTUS has the unique power to declare a law unconstitutional. The courts, whether state or federal, don't have the authority or power to write laws from the bench.  It's a valid question of abuse of discretion. The news and media rarely delve in to context or the details. The legal challenge in PA is about the courts actual authority to revise a law passed by the legislature.  Laws can be enforced in PA only if it's passed by the legislature. That was a big issue with Wolf's executive orders and their enforceability. His orders don't carry the effect of law to carry punitive measures. The legislature has that power.  The issues in PA involving shutdown orders and extension of the ballot is about abuse of discretion by the executive and judicial branches. So it is a constitutonal question in many ways.  The dangers of the case Trump is appealing are significant: if SCOTUS would hold the PA courts abused their discretion, it could invalidate the decision. If counties couldn't or didn't seperate ballots, there's a severe issue because there's allegations that poll workers and legal observers were improperly kicked out (I can't speak to the validity of those allegations).  The left prefers activist judges. FDR threatened to pack the court to push through his new deal. The activist vs originalist dynamic on SCOTUS has gone on for generations.   There are federal cases involving the shutdowns in PA working their way through the federal courts.  Alito released a decision stating he believed the PA Scotus extension likely was unconstitutional. He also was involved in shutdown cases.  There are federal election laws and state election laws. So legally contesting the election is costly and requires a lot of filings. The state exhaustion requirement forces individuals to first seek redress in the state court system. Hence Trump's team is filing in so many jurisdictions. If you fail to plead an issue, you can lose the right to bring it up on appeal.  As a lifelong PA resident I hope SCOTUS finds the pa court abused jurisdiction. The PA courts are the epicenter of corruption in PA and don't recognize federal supremacy or the federal constituton.  PA is the keystone of corruption in this country. And the court is half the problem if not more."

Conservative,akiseXyukki,Joe Biden wins the election 2020," The fact that the popular vote wouldn't match the outcome anymore makes a significant difference  here. You may call it legal, but that doesn't make it fair. This issue will likely keep getting worse with every election cycle, and the longer small states refuse to reform the electoral college, the more they will drive people to see rioting as their only path back to fair representation. If a president wins with 49% or 48% of the popular vote, that's probably not enough to plunge the country into widespread unrest yet. But what if it becomes 45%? 40%? How much underrepresenation is enough to drive people over the edge? Of course everyone has their own idea about that and some start rioting earlier than others, but the worse this gets, the worse the civil unrest will become, and at some point you can't really blame them anymore. We don't tell the people in Hong Kong to stop rioting and just accept it as it is that their constitution allows the CCP to appoint half their parliament through some undemocratic bullshit, after all."

I personally have a lot of success against her as Zyra, but I see Morg, Rakan, Janna, Naut, Leo, Bard, Raka, Taric, Panth, (maybe Swain if you are really good at him) all good options against her. But she does have some really powerful lanes, I personally find her really strong into Ashe, Luc, Varus(but who isn't good into Varus right now), and Xayah. In my experience playing Senna into her hard stomps her (can't W a non-projectile auto attack), Kaisa plays decently into her (but lane is 90% support matchup but in teamfights if Kai can isolate Sam she will burst her loopy fast. Now that is just my experience and Sam is banned pretty often so perhaps all these Sams in low diamond mmr absolutely blow."

Older trans people might even find it hard to find trans-oriented spaces where they feel they can relate to others. I can understand why some perspectives might even feel like a slap in the face to them.

Researchers have generally thought that only prehistoric males hunted‚Äîbut what if evidence against that idea has been lying in plain sight for decades?
BY MAYA WEI-HAAS
PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 4, 2020 An artist's depiction of what hunting may have looked like in the Andes Mountains of South America 9,000 years ago. Archaeologists were surprised when analysis of a hunter burial from the time period revealed the individual was biologically female. MATTHEW VERDOLIVO, UC DAVIS IET ACADEMIC TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
Randall Haas, an archaeologist at University of California, Davis, recalls the moment in 2018 when his team of researchers gathered around the excavated burial of an individual lain to rest in the Andes Mountains of Peru some 9,000 years ago. Along with the bones of what appeared to be a human adult was an impressive‚Äîand extensive‚Äîkit of stone tools an ancient hunter would need to take down big game, from engaging the hunt to preparing the hide. ""He must have been a really great hunter, a really important person in society""‚ÄîHaas says that‚Äôs what he and his team were thinking at the time. But further analysis revealed a surprise: the remains found alongside the toolkit were from a biological female. What's more, this ancient female hunter was likely not an anomaly, according to a study published today in Science Advances. The Haas team‚Äôs find was followed by a review of previously studied burials of similar age throughout the Americas‚Äîand it revealed that between 30 and 50 percent of big game hunters could have been biologically female. This new study is the latest twist in a decades-long debate about gender roles among early hunter-gather societies. The common assumption was that prehistoric men hunted while women gathered and reared their young. But for decades, some scholars have argued that these ‚Äútraditional‚Äù roles‚Äîdocumented by anthropologists studying hunter-gatherer groups across the globe since the 19th century‚Äîdon‚Äôt necessarily stretch into our deep past. While the new study provides a strong argument that the individual in Peru was a female who hunted, plenty of other evidence has long been lying in plain sight, says Pamela Geller, an archaeologist at the University of Miami who is not part of the study team. ""The data is there,‚Äù Geller says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a matter of how the researchers interpret it.‚Äù Whose tools?
When archaeologists excavated the burial, they found a colorful array of 24 stone tools. Among them: projectile points for taking down a large mammal; hefty rocks likely for cracking bones or stripping hides; small, rounded stony bits for scraping fat from pelts; tiny flakes with extra sharp edges that could have chopped the meat; and nodules of red ocher that could help preserve the hides. Scattered around the site were fragments of the bones of animals including ancient llama relatives and deer. In initial discussions about the toolkit, the researchers presumed the owner was male, perhaps a prominent figure of society, or even a chief of the group. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm as guilty as anyone,‚Äù says Haas, who has been working in the region since 2008. ‚ÄúI thought yeah, that makes sense with my understanding of the world.‚Äù Back in the lab, however, close inspection of the bones suggested the physiology of a biological woman. To confirm, they analyzed a protein that forms tooth enamel and is linked to sex. Importantly, the team cannot know the individual‚Äôs gender identity, but rather only biological sex (which like gender doesn‚Äôt always exist on a binary). In other words, they can‚Äôt say whether the individual lived their life 9,000 years ago in a way that would identify them within their society as a woman. Challenging assumptions
The 2018 discovery does pose a challenge to gender binaries commonly assumed for our early ancestors: Men acted as hunters, women acted as gatherers. This assumption comes from studies of modern hunter-gatherers, where men more frequently are responsible for the hunt while women bear the most responsibility for caring for children, says Arizona State University‚Äôs Kim Hill, who specializes in human evolutionary anthropology and was not part of the study team. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just stop in the middle of stalking a deer in order to nurse a crying baby,‚Äù Hill says via email. Yet inferences from present-day hunter-gatherers have limits. For decades, Geller says, some archaeologists have argued that the simple view of male hunters and female gatherers is in fact an oversimplification. ‚ÄúWith few exceptions, the researchers who study hunting and gathering groups‚Äîregardless of which continent they work on‚Äîpresume that a sexual division of labor was universal and rigid,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd because it is commonsensical, they then have a hard time explaining why female-bodied individuals also bear the skeletal markers of hunting or have hunting tool kits as grave goods.‚Äù When researchers have found signs of this discrepancy in the past, Geller says, ‚Äúusually they don‚Äôt say anything, as if ignoring the evidence will make it go away.‚Äù Hunting would likely require as many able-bodied adults as possible to increase safety and efficiency‚Äîregardless of their biological sex. After a child weans, the mother could be available to assist in big hunts, says Kathleen Sterling, an archaeologist at Binghamton University, who was not part of the study team. But even with babies, hunting could still be possible with community nursing assistance. The meaning of burial goods
Spurred by their 2018 discovery, Haas‚Äôs team then dug in to reports of past excavations of early hunter gatherers throughout the Americas. Many past studies have unearthed similar presence of stone hunting tools in burials with biological females, yet each case isn‚Äôt necessarily clear cut. For some, the sex is not definite. In others, disturbed contexts made it uncertain if stone tools and remains were buried at the same time. And in still others, the few projectiles found in the burial could have even been murder weapons interred with their victims. But when Haas‚Äôs teams reviewed the individual cases as part of a larger data set, they found that of the 27 of 429 burials with individuals of known sex who are were buried with hunting tools, 11 are female‚Äîincluding the newly identified remains‚Äîwhile 16 are male. The many uncertainties (such as disturbed context and sex identification) are present in burials of both males and females, Haas says. So even when the most uncertain cases were excluded, the abundance of burials with hunting tools among females and males remain similar. ‚ÄúThese patterns are not at all what you would expect in a population if males were [the only] hunters,‚Äù Haas says. ASU‚Äôs Hill says he‚Äôs not yet fully convinced that the female individual buried 9,000 years ago was actually a hunter in life. Burial goods, including hunting tools, could have been placed there because of symbolic or religious beliefs, he cautions. Did the newfound toolkit belong to the buried individual? Sterling challenged the inquiry itself. ‚ÄúWe typically don‚Äôt ask this question when we find these toolkits with men,‚Äù She says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only when it challenges our ideas about gender that we ask these questions.‚Äù Geller adds: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much mental gymnastics that go on trying to explain these things away.‚Äù The toolkit discovered in the 9,000-year-old burial was quite diverse, including both precious implements, like projectile points that are challenging to make, as well as more mundane tools, like stone flakes that can easily be crafted by smashing rocks. This hints the tools weren‚Äôt some type of offering; rather, it points to the objects being used by the individual in life, Haas contends. There‚Äôs also strength in the numbers, with an abundance of females now found to have been buried with tools throughout the Americas, Sterling adds. For Geller, the debate has important implications for today. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much gender disparity going on right now, if we were to presume that there‚Äôs something that biologically predisposes us, then you‚Äôd be able to justify that gender disparity,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTo me that‚Äôs dangerous, and completely unsubstantiated.‚Äù"

As for vtubers, it is the same thing in that way. Whether their persona is close or far from who they really are, (vtubers vs whatever we want to call Seraphine's twitter) anything that's being said, in the end, still affects real people. The replies Seraphine gave could very well be what the writer truly thinks, but with an added touch of fiction, which, in my opinion, doesn't make it different from vtubers. If anything, to me, that's a twitter equivalent of an ""actor"", which ironically still is what streamers and vtubers are at the end of the day."

In my opinion, if LS actually had a respectable career as a coach/analyst, the korean T1 fans would not mind him as he is not Malice. In 2019, LS ranked the best KR midlaners to be Chovy > Showmaker > Ucal (spring split) > Faker after A WHOLE YEAR of Faker out performing these fools, even solo killed Showmaker. He might be not as dominant in lane as some of these players are, but outside of lane, especially in teamfights/rotations, he did more. Not only that, remember JAG>G2? yikes. Remember LS in 2019 ranking Teddy below Ruler and Deft when he was the best adc from LCK the whole year and only Ruler was somewhat arguable.

unpopularopinion,cchmel91,America is not the ‚Äúmost divided it‚Äôs ever been‚Äù," Indeed, the divide I see in America now is a divide which doesn't stem from rational, it stems from the media and politicians calling each other names as a means to discredit the other due to a fundamental lack of policy that would actually win the public over if rationally argued for or explored in discussion. It's a game of winning by being the least hated, rather than the most liked. I'd say they aren't representatives, but they do a damn good job of getting people to believe in their idiocy. A political conversation should at the very basis be about critically exploring ideas and coming to the solution which presents the best objective outcome. It should always be open for change if the politicians wish to do what is best for society - as society is always changing. The absolutism in political discourse for the normal person is just a symptom of talking about a topic in which one doesn't understand to even the most basic levels. I think therefore I am, if you are certain and immovable about your political beliefs they are probably wrong be it in entirety or in pedantics, certainty is an exceptionally hard thing to achieve."

ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"Dear Asian Men: Black Women Are Considered FAR More Desirable Than You. You Are The LEAST Wanted Group On The Planet, According To The Facts. Thank God I'm Not An Asian Man, Lol"," The problem with this logic is that looks matter way less for men than they do for women.  A man's ability to get girls is mostly based on his game, and ability to seduce women, rather then looks. I have to admit women are way less superficial then men in this regard. And unlike a womens looks, which fade over time, a man's confidence and game only increases as he ages.  Can the average black girl who sluts herself out to anyone get sex easier than the average Asian guy? Sure! Ill agree with you on that. But for women, the game is to get commitment, not sex. Sex is easy for women to get in general. And seeing as 73% of black babies are born to single mothers who wondered where Tyrone went, you can see black women have a harder time keeping men around. "

Also, it's only natural for y'all to be hit on by men more, because women in general don't initiate, no matter how handsome the guy is. It's our job as guys to do the hitting on, so why would it concern us how often we get hit on by white women?

ToxicAMWF,,"My former (I hope) quapa stalker who is modding AMWF groups as ""proud mixed Asian"" wears MAGA hat, makes white power sign, wants...a white wife!"," White women in America are afforded extremely high value, and there are lots of men who have been indoctrinated to value them far above other races of women. A large population of men, both white and non-white, desiring white female partners vs. the supply of white female partners available will obviously shift the dating advantage to white women by a long shot. So yeah, no doubt it is very difficult for a quapa or other MOC to date a WF if he has so many men to compete with. Hell, it's gotten so competitive, even WM's find it difficult to date WF's. I totally can believe that he's a white supremacist though. Many Asian Americans don't really have a fully formed political identity, so they just latch onto whatever is available. A few align themselves with the intersectional left and other POC communities, but a huge portion of them still align with white politics, whether it's the right-wing or the left-wing. Add the fact that he's a quapa, which means he's probably at least 2 generations removed from ""Asian culture"", and yeah, no surprise he can go off bragging that he's a proud ""Asian"" while promoting white interests. If by being a ""proud Asian"" in America means shilling for white people and their racism and thirsting after white people for romantic partners while shitting on other Asians and other POC's, then yes, in that regard, he is absolutely very ""Asian"" given the current state of the Asian American community, their politics, and their sense of identity in Western countries. Tell him to check out AznIdentity or Hapas. He'll feel right at home."

I grew up with a lot of these kinds of low self-esteem, insecure white girls, and while they're all different and unique in the way they manifest their insecurities, the main unifying thread is really the lack of being validated for being the best, prettiest, most special girl in the room. That entitlement to attention and the impossibility of validating every single white girl in the room can lead to a lot of bitterness and resentment to develop in these kinds of girls. These girls can't get validation or attention from mainstream white society, and when it comes to romantic relationships, from white men, and that's part of the reason why some of them end up going to POC communities to go scouring for potential romantic partners. Non-white men are already primed by the media to be receptive and desire white women, so it's easy pickings for them and they get never-ending amounts of validation, attention and praise that they would typically never get in their white communities. Of course, there will be problems that will arise when the reality of joining a POC community comes to fruition, and they no longer just see the nice parts of the community and begin seeing the truly horrendous and ugly things that these communities face. And if they have children, it will be practically impossible to dissociate from these communities when shit gets tough like they could in the past as a free white person.  It doesn't help that a lot of these types of mentally ill white women have the emotional maturity and coping skills of a 14-year old girl even though they're well into their 30's and 40's. They can't even handle their own issues, much less deal with bigger issues like racism which impacts large communities of people."
ToxicAMWF,,"P is back! jfl at Anna Gigahypocrite Cake who repeatedly shamed me for ""not trying to work things with Asian MIL and be filial like her""."," The psychology of the type of WF you're talking about is actually very interesting. If you want to understand these types of WF's, you have to go back to these girls' childhoods. Usually, these girls were the shy and meek conservative types who were social rejects growing up, and usually have a conservative family who they're generally close to. Usually, when we think about people who have good relationships with their parents, we generally think that these people are well adjusted, normal people. That can be true up to a certain extent, but with these types of people, that's not what happens. Keep in mind that we live in a society that has grown more image-obsessed, sexually permissive and exhibitionist as the decades have gone by. This type of cultural environment generally clashes very heavily with the types of values that these girls grow up with, and it comes to a head when it comes to the types of values that are transmitted to younger people who then use it to place judgment on each other. Under this environment, the shy, studious, conservative girls who don't wear makeup/pretty clothes/do much personal grooming are considered to be of ""low value"" and they're generally derided as boring, prudish, loser, etc., while the pretty, well-groomed, gregarious, colorful and sexually open girls are considered to be of ""high value"" - fun, adventurous, popular.  Conservative white girls who experience this culture clash generally go two ways -   The former is the type people are more familiar with and is more visible in the mainstream cultural narrative, both because of the dramatic, eye-catching internal and external transformation that the conservative girl goes through to become the ""liberated"" popular girl, and because their transformation has an implicit undertone of validating that the mainstream culture is better than their ""backwards"" conservative culture. The latter type of girl's rebellion is just as equally strong, although it tends to simmer under the surface rather than explode into a visible transformation. These types of girls are usually devalued in society for not exhibiting the qualities that are considered to be ""attractive"" for a woman, and a lot of them really tend to take it to heart.  , and it becomes a truly amazing case of ad-hoc self-rationalization as a coping mechanism: - If the pretty girl who dresses to the 9's and who is well-groomed is considered more attractive than me while I'm here in my regular T-shirt, jeans, and no makeup, it's because the pretty girl is shallow and is likely stupid, so I'm better than her. - If a girl is more popular with boys, it's because she's a slut and I'm more virtuous, so I'm better than her. - If a girl has more girls wanting to be her friend to hang out than me, it's because she is extremely basic in her interests and viewpoints, and has the lowest common denominator type of personality, and I'm more unique and interesting, so I'm better than her. -If boys don't like me and they pick the popular, pretty girl over me, then it's because the boys are shallow, low class pigs who can't see the value in a good woman like me, so I'm too good for these men.  This is also why you see a lot of these types of WF's going after AM's. It's not really because they generally find AM's to be just as attractive or more attractive than WM's. It's because a lot of them, having been burned by society's, including WM's, overall social rejection, have gone towards AM's as a huge ""fuck you"" to a culture that never placed value on them. A lot of them tend to naively internalize the stereotypes that Asians (and Asian men) are more traditional, family-oriented, studious, stable, etc. and who they believe hold the same values as themselves. These WF's then believe that they themselves are ""specially suited"" for this type of ""special man"" who can understand them and where they come from and start pursuing these men to validate their self-worth. This type of belief that they have of themselves is exacerbated even more by the white-worshipping, self-hating behaviors of some AM's for WF's as partners, so a lot of these WF's naively believe that AMs' interest in them is because of only their worth as a person and their values, and not because a lot of these AMs are extremely self-hating and want a WF on their arm to gain mainstream acceptance and recognition. You add on top of the fact that AM's are visibly demeaned against in society, and AM's themselves explicitly state that having a WF on their arm will help elevate them, and these WF's fall even more by believing that not only are they of high worth, but they can do good by ""saving"" the AM from the evil mainstream culture. Add on top of all the stereotypes that WF's have been attributed to have, like their ""superior physical beauty"", which they internalize about themselves and you've got these types of truly bizarre, mentally fucked up WF's that you see here. LOL and of course, because a lot of these WF's are already insecure little pricks to begin with, they then begin demeaning AF's who they view as a competitive threat to their validation as a ""special woman"" by the AM's they ""chose"" and that's when they begin engaging in ad-hoc rationalizations to put down AF's and other WOC's who they believe are of lower worth as potential partners, and yes, those rationalizations will include racial stereotyping. From the perspective of a lot of AF's and other WOC's who see this behavior exhibited by these types of WF's, it justifiably seems like absolutely heartless and racist bullying from a woman who's already in a very privileged place in society as a WF. But the truth is these types of WF's have been practicing this kind of self-elevating put-down behavior since they were young women to ALL types of women, including other WF's. A WOC is easier to demean simply because they're already considered to be different from these types of WF's and lucky for them, there's already a packaged set of negative stereotypes pegged to WOC's, so the natural course of action for these mentally ill WF's is to exploit it so they can continue to assuage their own low self-esteem.  If you switched the genders, you can easily attribute this mentality to WM incels as well. There's actually a lot more overlap between WF's and WM's in this regard, despite either side's lack of comfort in admitting so. It is still a type of ""othering"" and ""racializing"" behavior that a lot of AM's and other MOC's can't or don't want to see which they mistaken for anti-racist behavior when it is, in reality, quite the contrary. This may sound odd, but to put it in more abstract terms, these WF's are not really grounded in the ""reality"" of the world they inhabit and they're more immersed in a ""me vs the world"", ""good vs. evil"", ""black vs. white"" fantasy that they play out in their own heads. In the ""real"" world, they believe themselves to be ignored, undesired, considered to be unattractive, are social rejects and do not get the amount of attention and respect that they think they deserve. But in their own pseudo-fantasy world, in a ""good and just"" world, they would be the belle of the ball, the girl that everyone wants to be who all the girls will be jealous of and who all the boys would desire and want. And in this world of hers, the attractive WM's who have rejected her in the ""real"" world will be relegated to the reject pile, while AM's who she chose to play the ""Prince Charming"" role will whisk her off her feet into the sunset where they all live happily ever after. AMWF is the ultimate couple in this fantasy, the emblem of all that is good and virtuous with the WF as the good, kind, intelligent and beautiful leading lady with the AM worshipping and lauding her as a man should to such a wonderful woman, as an antidote to the cold reality that doesn't recognize her as such... Too bad that's all it really will ever be... a fantasy. Ah well. *Shrug* Its really ironic, considering that AM‚Äôs pursue WF‚Äôs as the ticket TO mainstream acceptance, while the WF pursues the AM in her fantasy world as a rejection AWAY from mainstream society and values. How anyone can rationalize that these two kinds of people are compatible and acting in good faith based on their perspectives and values alone is beyond me."

Yes, some designs are inherently niche. The void has a singular purpose and all of those creatures have to play into that, but not all creatures are of the void. Minotaurs and Vastaya just   in Runeterra. They can just be people. Stories and fantasies like Yasuo, Jhin, Xin Zhao, Sivir, etc. have no reason to be human exclusive. (Maybe Xin since Demacia is probably racist towards magical races too). Riot just refuses to make non-human stories that aren't about the fact that they're inhuman.  Here, I'll give you a few. An outcast, abandoned by his tribe and forced to survive alone in the harsh environment with blade and sheer grit. He's also a Freljordian wolf Vastaya. A renowned Noxian general who leads the charge and inspires his troops with his indomitable resolve. He's also a Minotaur. As the adoptive daughter of an ancient mage, she follows his footsteps, traveling Runeterra and mastering many forms of magic, allowing her to summon and control elementals in order to mount a force against the void. She's also an Awakened Owl, or an Owl Vastaya, or literally fucking anything that looks smart. You can tell a story or form a character fantasy with an inhuman character without that fantasy being entirely based on how they're inhuman."
leagueoflegends,SleepyWood009,About LS as a Korean fan," He was laughing because the veigar is freezing ( a concept which alot of pro player refused to do in high elo) but apparently a silver player can. I also laughed too when i first saw this. I think its unfair if you just go through a segment and then base the whole video. I understand its a extremely long video but i assume the segment you go through is painfully short. Because you say he is laughing at the player at hes coaching or laugh at something outside of the game at 16:45. But he literally explains it few seconds later in 17:40. You must understand that LS is coaching in the middle of a live game, after he will bring up the replay ( its at 40 minute mark).  Lets use an example,assuming the person you are teaching was extremely bad at math.You are not going to finish the entire page of math question yourself first. Then ask him to redo the whole paper. You might say of course i am going to teach him/handhold. That however would inefficient imo because A)You haven't found out what the actual issue of the trainee (example you found out he wasn't bad at all of the topic) B)the trainee will just rewrite whatever he remember instead of doing it (example he remember this answer is B,that answer is A etc.) Get the same question with different number and suddenly hes out of luck. C)If you handhold him,will he able to do it again without your pressence? (example you say oh you should add this you minus that) If you are absent will he be able to do it?aka he doesn't get the concept So Ls tried to explain it roughly in the live game then explain truely in detailed later in the replay. LS does have a goal in mind when he coaches is that he wants to you to be able to grasp the concept so you are able to apply it yourself. Hes not going to fix the problem for you straight away hes going to give you the tools you might not have thought of in the past in order to fix it. I think thats a big contradiction to what LS is as an analyzer, because whatever he do, he always make sure to prove it that it works by testing it multiple time himself to make sure it works. addition to that,He ask other pro player, he ask other players to test it out and give feedback. If that isn't biggest example of self-awareness idk what is. Also i would like to add that I assume by the rest of us you mean the reddit poster/commenter, let me tell you that reddit poster/commenters aren't exactly the highest of high to judge an analyst....

I can't remember the last time I've had too. However the point I was making is punishment versus abuse. If I were abusing then I would use that as my primary method I would think? 2: I agree with you about this. But when they are way out of line do you just softly speak to them for hours if needed, until they calm down? As a parent you are an authority figure, you are who they look up to on how to behave, and sometimes that means direct and assertively. Sometimes the best action is the direct one. 3: again this has nothing to do with raising children its a straw man. 4: thank you for your compassion toward me. I believe you mean that. However its not necessary, I dont think its ok to just go around hitting people, far from it. But I also don't believe there is never any reason not to hit someone either.  5: and yet again, a quick smack on the ass for stealing food or being aggressive is not beating your dog. I wonder, have you ever seen a bitch raise a pup? They use corporal punishment. When the pup is out of line she will sometimes bite the puppy, just hard enough to start to hurt its order to correct its behaviour. I have witnessed this having many dogs growing up. Mandy when there is enough for a pack a dominant one will ""lead"" and expect the others to fall in line, sometimes with the help of another member of the pack. Its how they maintain groups as a social creature. That's not contentious to anyone who has been around dogs their whole life. And you raise them in a way they understand. Yes 99 percent of the time positive renforecment is the best way, but not always. Your idea that everyone needs to have their dogs professionally trained is hilarious. Especially because both of the ones I know of near where I live teach how to properly apply ""physical reprimands"" ie. Corporal punishment.  Look I believe we are at an impasse. I do hope you are doing well and I wish you goodnight, I mean that as well. But I think it clear that this discussion isn't going to change either of our minds and so is pointless."

[Warning - This post is a bit deep so I would advise against reading this if you are new to this subreddit]"," I really enjoyed reading that comment. Thanks for sharing that.  What's fascinating to me is how Friedrich Nietzsche spotted something odd about Christianity in Europe that as far as my understanding goes, left him with a begrudging respect for it. Nietzsche is one of my all-time favourite philosophers and it's a shame that he gets a bad rep. He despised the ethic of respecting the weak and hating the powerful, whether they were wealthy or psychologically powerful.  And yet, in this creation of a supreme being beyond anyone's comprehension that was All-knowing, and all powerful, what happened during the enlightenment era with the scientific revolution is that the search for understanding God lead to God turning into the search for truth itself.  God turned into just Truth."

As Usual NO Evidence To Back Up Their Delusional Claims"," Ooh, what have you seen? So far, the only freaking out I've seen is from Stormfront discussion boards (which I visit out of curiosity and for shits and giggles), and they have been constantly making videos and essays to discuss this topic for years. LOL I didn't want to say it explicitly, but yeah, that was the conclusion that I was implying heh. You've got to keep in mind that the AM's on these boards are in their early 20's to much older, so they definitely grew up during the post-Marilyn Monroe era when blonde haired white women were promoted excessively all the way through the 2000's until very VERY recently in the mid-2010's. Blonde white women during these time periods have always been considered the prize in white-majority Western countries, and at the time, any man who could get one was deemed as top-notch and respectable. Despite what a lot of them say about being prideful of their Asian heritage, it's very obvious that a huge portion of them have never really developed any inner confidence for themselves and thus are looking to validate their self-worth via a trophy white girlfriend/wife. Add on top of that an oppressive racial hierarchy that's been telling them from day one they're worthless, and you can see how they go on this path. It also explains why a lot of them are so stubborn to not consider seeing black women, Latina women, other non-Asian WOC's as just as worthy of being valued as white women. They've definitely internalized that racial hierarchy that's been taught to them from birth, and if they've reduced a woman's worth to only being a marker that validates a man's position and status in society, then yes, it's very obvious that under this mode of thinking using that same racial hierarchy, they will never look at black women, Latina women, etc. in the same way as WF's, no matter how much they claim they're not racist. For a lot of them, it seems that they're still stuck on this path of getting a trophy WF simply to assuage the insecurities and lack of validation they've experienced growing up as little boys and teenagers. Contrast this with white men who are their age who are readily willing to accept these new beauty standards that place black, Latina, etc. women as attractive. White men, due to being born in a society that already validates them, don't have these kinds of racial hang-ups, so they're definitely going to be more open to accepting the beauty of other women, although they have different problems given their dominant position in society and that they can use it to engage in problematic fetishization of WOC's. But that's a different story for another day. We'll see how this plays out. We won't really know what the effects of these changes will be until we see the next generation of POC's and white people who've grown up in this time period during their formative years. If the change is drastic enough and if AznIdentity is still around in the future, they may actually find themselves dealing with a generation of Asian men who don't really give a crap about pairing up with white women and some may actually be vehemently against it. That intergenerational conflict will be stark as hell, because it will pretty much be an interaction between two different groups of men from two different cultural backgrounds, despite being of the same race. Either way, I'm excited to see how this plays out, only out of pure scientific/sociological curiosity. I've always wondered when I was younger whether it would ever be feasible to apply an experiment where we could measure public perceptions of different racial groups if the media images at the time that predominantly featured white people were suddenly replaced with media that showed groups of other people, and then compare the two. I thought for the longest time that it was never going to happen in my lifetime, but it seems that it's actually finally making headway in this direction, and I cannot be more excited to see what happens. This truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, folks, and it can be very enlightening indeed."

Everyone knows full well that they have no problems using Asians as a bludgeon to knock down affirmative action for black and Latinx people so they can get more of their own in. If they succeed and affirmative action is taken down for a merit-only system, a lot of them will then suddenly turn around and say, ""Well, these spots in these nice educational institutions and nice cushy jobs in Silicon Valley and Wall Street should only be reserved for actual Americans...."", which is a nice, polite way of saying those nice jobs are for white people only. I can't tell you how many countless fake-ass conservatives who default to this line of thinking every single time this discussion comes up. Bring up affirmative action, they'll bring up how it should be merit-based, and ""Oh, think of the poor Asians."" Bring up the fact that under an actual merit system, Asians could make up 60-70% of the incoming student population, including Ivy Leagues, and they'll start backtracking and go, ""Well...maybe we should have some kind of accommodation..."" Pfft, all their ramblings about having principles, and in the end, they don't mean anything that they say. HA! They're opportunistic users who are playing the game for their own advantage, using any group that they can use to further their own interests. I understand where a lot of Asians are coming from trying to provide better opportunities for their kids, that's expected for any group. But they're fools if they think latching on to right-wing white conservatives who are so obviously using them as attack dogs to further their own interests is going to give them what they want. Same here, and I don't think that this Left vs. Right dichotomy is going to get better anytime soon. A lagging economy with not enough resources to go around, corruption at the very top, failures in foreign policy abroad, and rising tensions between whites and minorities are not issues that can be resolved easily. Unless if something major happens that changes the game, we should expect these kinds of divisions to be the norm from now on. :/"

As Usual NO Evidence To Back Up Their Delusional Claims"," The dating landscape is constantly changing, so even their statements that this is going to continue to remain the way it is forever is wrong. Especially considering the amount of social change that's been happening in these past couple of years. The desirability of different races/genders of people is heavily tied to their promotion in public life, accumulation of power, and economic purchasing power, among other factors that are related to status. I can bet $1000 that it has lot less to do with ""biological"" or ""physical"" features, beyond not looking like you're emaciated/malnourished/deformed, etc. Asian men being seen as ""more desirable"" than they were the past 10 or 20 years has less to do with Asian mens' inherent, ""biological attractiveness"" as much as increased positive media exposure from Asian media sources (especially Korean) and the increasing prevalence of an immigrant, white-collar professional class that has been growing in Western countries for a while. Black men are also seeing increasing visibility too, given that there has previously and still continues to have an increasingly strong presence of black men in the entertainment industry, and now, political and intellectual life. White mens' desirability in the dating landscape is slowly decreasing not just because the visibility/power of Asian men, black men, Latino men, etc. is sharply rising, but also because they themselves are seeing a decrease in their own status, with deteriorating health, job prospects, and political presence (especially within the liberal/Democratic party), especially among blue-collar working class white men. WOC's are also experiencing this change as well, especially black and Latina women, who have been seeing increasing presence and influence in entertainment, politics, business, etc. I'm seeing more and more WOC's as major singers/entertainers/models, and a lot of the new entertainment that's coming out features a lot of WOC actresses. Also especially more WOC's who figure prominently in politics, especially on the Democratic side. Beauty standards are also changing, with the old standard of blonde hair/blue eyes/European ancestry slowly beginning to recede away for darker skin, dark hair, a sort of ""racially ambiguous"" standard. It's not to say that every single woman from every race will fulfill this standard, and it's also not to say that there won't be white women who won't fit these standards either. However, given that these features are ""natural"" for all races, it will definitely level the playing field between white women and WOC's because all races of women can potentially look like this, unlike the blonde hair/blue eyes standards which, by its promotion, almost always excludes WOC's. Because of this, the next generation of white women should expect to see more competition from other WOC's and not just among themselves for the most high-quality men. Overall, although progress is slow, things are pretty much looking up for all races except for white people, who will actually see their prospects lower, including romantically speaking. It will only feel like it's lowered for white people because they have occupied the top position for so long, so any adjustment towards equality will feel like a step down. If this trend continues, either more and more white people may find themselves in the position of actually having to work hard to compete with non-whites that they didn't feel any threat from before, or they'll start throwing even bigger fits of anger than the ones we saw starting in 2015-2016. Given the way a lot of white people are reacting these days, I'm guessing it's going to be more of the latter instead of the former."

Feminism,Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,Identifying the Primary Aggressor and the Myth of Mutual Abuse," From the intro: Studies suggest that as many as one out of ten young people will experience physical abuse in a dating relationship. Teen dating violence
is similar to adult dating or domestic violence in many ways ‚Äì the underlying dynamic of power and control, for example ‚Äì but it is also unique in critical ways. Among these differences is the perception that teen dating violence is less gendered and more mutual than adult dating violence. Often, however, what appears to be ‚Äúmutual‚Äù violence or abuse is not mutual at all: one teen is the predominant aggressor whose actions are intended to exert power and control over a dating partner, whereas the other teen‚Äôs actions are more defensive. The roles within a particular relationship may not always be immediately clear and many teens themselves assign blame for physical violence to both partners without considering the dynamics underlying an abusive relationship. When service providers assume that the violence is mutual, they risk endangering the victim‚Äôs physical safety and emotional well-being. Identifying the predominant aggressor is therefore an important step for service providers in assessing a dating violence situation and offering the best help possible to all parties involved."

Grassroot activism works. Forced pregnancy = reproductive slavery"," No problem! And I don't understand why you're being downvoted, that was a good question. This ruling affects a relatively small fraction of all pregnancies, and yet it's so cruel I'd be incredulous if this wasn't happening in my own country. To expand slightly on this topic, there are many more reasons to protest: the demonstrations are joined by farmers and other dissatisfied groups; and the constitutional court that issued the ruling wasn't perfectly legal as well. It's a chaos which might turn into a revolution. The president is trying to placate the protesters by proposing to return to the previous abortion compromise (i.e. legal in case of sexual assault, severe fetal conditions or endangered mother's life), but with the exclusion of Down's syndrome. However, many protesters - it's difficult to give numbers because they vary a lot depending on who's polling - are demanding free access to abortion, not just compromise. I would consider myself one of them, because my personal understanding of ""forced pregnancy"" includes also situations of coercion (difficult to prove in court, thus currently illegal) or lack of education. I'd never force an accidentally pregnant teenager to become a parent - because their ""irresponsibility"" is the failure of the school system. Hopefully with this I managed to shed some more light on the Polish protests."

Grassroot activism works. Forced pregnancy = reproductive slavery"," Unfortunately I can't think of a good written source at the moment... But the key reason for the protests is that the court ruling deemed abortion on the grounds of severe or terminal fetal conditions illegal. The idea was officially to ""save all the lovely babies with Down's syndrome that are being murdered by selfish mothers"" (paraphrasing the proponents of the ban), but the ruling extends to fetuses developing without key organs, suffering from chromosomal trisomy etc. Theoretically, under this new ruling termination of pregnancy is still allowed when mother's life is in danger. However, this is a clearly macabre situation, because if those complications do not occur, women are forced to carry to term children who may die moments after birth, or those requiring lifelong intensive care - with barely any government support for parents of disabled children. It does not need to be said that this is an insanely traumatic experience nobody should be forced to go through because of a half-baked, barbaric legislation."

It makes everyone feel like they're respected and part of a team. If you speak in another language instead (and the third person doesn't speak it) then you are putting a barrier not only between you and them, but between people who do and don't speak your language in general. You're reinforcing the language barrier, which creates a feeling of alienation. If there is a lingua franca that everyone understands, it's usually best to speak that, and avoid the language barrier problem whenever possible. If any two people around me are having a conversation that I can hear, I would rather be able to understand it 80% of the time and I think most people are the same way."

ToxicAMWF,,Aznidentity's kind of women.," Hey there, just wanted to say I saw your attempts to peacefully ‚Äúdebate‚Äù (lol) with the members there, and I commend you for being so calm and collected despite facing all of that retardation. A lot of them have become extremely entrenched in this ideology as a coping mechanism, very similar to the alt-right, and unfortunately, coping mechanisms are never conceived from a rational standpoint, and more as an emotional reaction. Many others have tried to engage in a conversation with them, but like all ideologues, they‚Äôve been met with the ‚Äúmy way or the highway‚Äù attitudes. At this point, it is a moot to engage with them, because it is very obvious that they would rather stay entrenched in their viewpoints than engage in any sincere dialogue. This sub was originally created to critique the hypocritical, white-worshipping obsession of AMWF that these subs constantly practiced. But increasingly, it‚Äôs also become probably one of the few platforms available that is openly dedicated to calling out, critiquing and mocking the ridiculous ideology that motivates these subs that other Asian subs have either avoided doing or were bullied into silence. It truly says something about the state of Asian racial awareness when a sub dedicated to TRULY pointing out white worship for both AMs and AFs was not started by Asian people themselves, but non-Asian WOC who are interested and invested in the Asian community. It‚Äôs a sad state of affairs, and it‚Äôs sad it happened so late, but it‚Äôs beter than nothing, I guess haha. Anyways, enough with my rambling haha. Welcome to the sub! :)"

ToxicAMWF,AVWEFILAVWTIUTA,It's just pathetically sad how much trouble Chans will go through just to pedastalize AMWF. They're celebrating AMWF in Russia but are they celebrating AMBF in Africa? NOPE.," Pretty much this. The users on that sub, including the head mod, were all applauding and cheering about how less racist Russians are to Asians and how Russians more Asian are compared to Westerners. Nevermind the fact that overt racism is pretty common against Asians there, and the Russian President himself stated (and it's been confirmed by historians) that Russian culture and society is built around on Orthodox Christianity and is a derivative of Roman civilization that is also the birthplace of other European cultures, and he intends to keep it white and Christian for as long as he lived. They also celebrated the fact that the AF's are actively being overlooked by these supposedly non self-hating, prideful AM's for Russian white women. In fact, given how prevalent AMWF is with Eastern European women, you would definitely expect some lonely and overlooked AF's in these places. Are you seeing any of these AM's fighting to pair up with these AF's out of loyalty for their race/culture? No. Do you see these AM's being okay with the idea of AF's fighting to pair up with Russian WM's because their own men don't want them? No. What, so it's a crime when AM's are lonely and expected to grow old by themselves, but AF's are supposed to stay lonely and grow old alone waiting for that one magical non-white worshipping AM in Russia to sweep them off their feet? Their hypocrisy is unbelievable. They are just the same as the selfish, white-worshipping Lu's who look at AM's as back-ups and only become ""loyal"" when they have no choice but to settle for them because white people don't want them, hence their anger. In reality, they don't really want AF's - they want WF's but because WF's generally don't want AM's and when they do, they have the upper hand in being picky with AM's, so they expect AF's to line up as a backup option for them when they fail. They could've fooled unsuspecting others that the lack of AMWF in Western countries is due to AMs' loyalties to AF's, but the massive amount of marriage of AM's to Eastern European women is a major dent in their theory that they're somehow more loyal to AF's. It blows it apart, and it proves that when given the chance, AM's will backstab and shit on AF's the same way AF's have shitted on AM's if they're ever given the chance by WF's the same way WM's have given to AF's."

Scientific studies have shown beauty is for a great part not in the eye of the beholder but interracially geneticly inhereted. Example. All male topmodels from every race share common facial and other physical traits that are loved by females of any race. Everyone is born with the same predisposition to be biased towards certain physical traits. Thus being favorable to one race and less to others because of these hardwired physical preferences. Asian male hypocrisy doesn't begin or end with them. Every male of every ethnicity has this hypocrisy. Chinese males however have the short end of the stick on every facet of life and dating. At least Chinese females still get to indulge in white flesh. Chinese males AND females hate their own race. And that is for a reason.
ToxicAMWF,Murderthem,I left my AMWF group permanently and feel awesome: here I share the real reasons behind my decision," I am trying to understand what this sub is all about. I knew WMAF relations is a thing. And the AF's shunning their own race. I never knew some aucasian women do have a thing for asian men like you do and there's a scene? . In my experience it is nichemarket, something you never see unless you look for it very hard. What kind of asian men do you date. Also Indian and Chinese? All Chinese men know about the AF toxicity. Modern Chinese men however, brought up emasculated by their mothers. Do not see through their mothers wrong doing. They are still bainwashed.  What is a EurasianTiger?"
ToxicAMWF,,I left my AMWF group permanently and feel awesome: here I share the real reasons behind my decision," Downvotes are pretty common in this sub from these lurking AMs and HMs, and maybe even a few of the WF sycophants in relationships with AMs that you‚Äôve talked about before. The intensity in downvotes that you must be getting may be due to the fact that you are a WF who has been with AMs before, but you‚Äôre now spilling the tea on all the negative aspects of it that you‚Äôre not supposed to. It‚Äôs like you said, a lot of these pro-AMWF people only want to portray the good parts of the relationships without broaching on the bad parts. They truly are desperate to uphold the ‚ÄúAMWF supremacy‚Äù trope, and like you‚Äôve said, it is plain sad that they derive their self-esteem from a myth they want to push down everyone‚Äôs throats in a fascist way.  It‚Äôs really an issue of shifting blame from themselves. They can critique WFs who‚Äôve never dated AMs as racists easily. They can dismiss AFs who criticize AMs as self-hating easily (even though Asian women have the most exposure to AMs out of all groups of women). But when a WF who has a history of dating AMs goes and criticizes AMs for their misogyny and problematic behavior, it presents a challenge and problem to them. They can‚Äôt accuse these WFs of racism because these WFs are willing to have sex, date and maybe even marry AMs, and if they do, it would basically contradict the belief they constantly peddle out that ‚ÄúAll WFs who are willing to date/marry AMs are pro-Asian/anti-racist‚Äù. They also can‚Äôt accuse WFs of being white-worshipping because... well... WFs are white themselves. They are virtually in no position to make excuses and shift blame to the WF for pointing out their problematic behavior, so they start freaking out and begin acting irrationally by then.  This is a long answer, but that‚Äôs pretty much what‚Äôs going behind their minds, and hence why you have the negative responses you‚Äôve been getting from these loser AMs. I don‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs just you, though, I see a lot of WFs and other non-Asian XFs on YouTube and other social media who‚Äôve had histories of dating AMs getting wind of their pathologies and they‚Äôre beginning to increasingly speak out. God knows how these AMs will react in the future.  Good luck to you :( I hope you find a good guy for yourself, regardless of race or background. "
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"Subtle Halfie Traits Is A Circle Jerk Of Asian Passing Hapas Begging For Affirmation That They Look ""White"""," I don‚Äôt know what his upbringing is, but it honestly could also be because he‚Äôs around Asian people who tell him and treat him as if he‚Äôs white. I‚Äôve met Asian people from Asia who basically look at Hapas the same way white people in western countries look at Hapas, except it‚Äôs in the reverse. If you have features that are even a smidgen considered to be ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, you‚Äôre pegged as a white foreigner, and you start getting asked a lot of questions about your background.  It really opened my eyes when I started regularly hearing Asians from Asia saying things like, ‚ÄúWhite features are so strong in mixed kids‚Äù and ‚ÄúThose kids look 100% white‚Äù even when the kids had very noticeable ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù features. I always thought it was the other way around given that I and many others who have grown up in western countries have been brought up to believe the whole ‚ÄúAsian features are so strong‚Äù, but I guess it really is a matter of your socialization and which environment you were brought up in.  Given all of this, it also does make me laugh when some of these Westernized Asian men from these subs go off and say that their AMWF kids will be accepted like other Asians in Asia. Asian countries are not western countries. Half-white Hapas can pass as Asian in western countries, because western countries still have a white majority population and a very small minority of Asian people, and most white people who are not exposed to enough Asians and Hapas will not be able to discern any minute differences. In Asian countries, it‚Äôs the other way around, where half-white Hapas can pass as white, but definitely not Asian. Besides, the whole ‚Äú(insert Asian ethnicity) man‚Äôs mixed kids are the only ones who can be accepted as (insert Asian ethnicity)‚Äù really only applies if the Asian man has children with a woman from another Asian ethnicity that can pass as the man‚Äôs ethnicity, like Chinese-Korean mixed people compared to full Chinese people. One can even scroll through historical accounts of Asian people from ancient times, and yes, even then they made distinctions between the native Asian population, mixed children, and immigrant non-Asian passing ethnic populations.  Both western and Asian countries apply these modes of thinking, only tailored to their own social norms. Hence the confusion that I think a lot of these Hapas will experience. Idk what his life experience is, but yes, I agree with many others here, he will not definitely not pass for white in Western countries."

Why would you hold any position at all regarding God if you knew you could never prove or disprove (using the scientific method) something as vague as God. And by the way, I don't think you can, ever, prove or disprove the existence of God, since the goal posts keep moving and I don't think anyone really truely agrees on what the word God actually means anymore. ‚Äã God's (not the monotheistic one of Islam, Judaism and Christianity) used to be icons that could influence worshippers just because the worshippers believed in them.

My sister used to ask questions like ""Why is this happening to me,"" and struggled with jealousy and stuff like that. I never felt any of that though. It never made sense to me that there was a purpose to life. I think that's actually a fairly modern addition to religion. The evidence suggests that we practiced animism until the Neolithic farming revolution 12k years ago. And then transitioned to a worship of the elements, like the sun, the moon and the stars, and eventually hero worship. Anthropomorphizing gods only began to be popularized around the dawn of writing 5.5k years ago.  And an omniscient, omnipresent, all knowing god is an invention of the last 3000 years. I think the earliest spiritual thinking actually stems from the scientific pursuit of knowledge, and trying to understand the planets and the stars. But as it became more widespread it radicalized over time. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians probably would have thought we were nuts if they had witnessed the crusades. Religion since the bronze age collapse has taken a really dark turn. People weren't nearly as superstitious before."

Feminism,PalmFruitWine,Discuss: Were women more empowered in the 90s than now?," Well a lot of what you talked about is just pop culture which has little to do with the actual rights/experiences of most women. But yes there was less visible and definitely less organized misogyny and fundamentalism, also the lack of porn was nice. It's because of the internet, and I don't know what we can do about that. In the 90s, guys like that mostly had to either keep to themselves or else go outside and meet others and become more social. They couldn't go online and sulk and fall into fundamentalism quite so easily, and the lack of endless free porn kept sexual / body expectations more realistic. But I don't think ""empowerment"" was any different then than now. Just generally speaking, women have made advancements in every area of society, and part of the negative current stuff that you describe is backlash against these changing norms and experiences."

The truck is currently driving down the most important avenues of downtown Seoul, including SK Telecom's HQ and Gangnam.

Or help players think outside the box when they come to a wall they are struggling to overcome (whether its meta changes, team dynamics, etc)? Coaching in general isn't just knowledge of the game. You're there as a guiding force and to lead the players along a straight path.    There are other coaches IN Korea that don't play LoL, but coach LCK rosters. There are dozens of coaches, in the LCK, who were complete no names last year, yet are coaching dozen of LCK and LPL rosters (some of them even notable worlds rosters)? Also as your above point, LS does play the game at a high level (higher than most LCK coaches that do play) and has a public portfolio of vods / drafts / etc . But that is apparently not enough? ‚Äã So someone like Parth must be a good coach then? or someone the dozen other coaches that go both ways, where they start out abysmally / good, yet suddenly become good / bad when there teams are winning without basing it on the games quality.   Like personally I don't understand the whole ""Past Achievements"" logic. Does that make Piglet a good player cause hes a former WC. Or the dozen other WC players / coaches that end up falling off the map into obscurity."
leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," 100% agree with that honestly. Riot thinks that champs are popular just cause they are X champ or Y champ while Z champ is unpopular just because the players don't like them. This isn't the case or more accurately, doesn't NEED to be the case. Wukong was a good example of this. Before his rework very few people played him, he was a weird pick and people would say you were trolling if you picked him in ranked. But Riot isn't devoting any time to improve anything else with him to maybe explore the popularity he COULD generate if he were to be more visually appealing or had a stronger lore. ""Why expand our popular champ pool when Yasuo already generates plenty of popularity? throw him into everything league related, bring him to bildgewater just so he can be added to the RPG we're having made and make Yasuo 2.0 so we have more excuses to include more Yasuo stuff."" and then they WONDER why there's such a HUGE gap in champ popularity?"

You could legit go the same way and be like ""Yo we should always pick ppl with no experience. You know who else had practically no experience in governing? George Washington. And he was a great president therefore no experience = great shit."" Plus, there is a massive difference between going from a player in another game to being the head coach of T1 and going from running businesses (mostly unsuccessful) to running the fucking country lol. For one, we don't know jack shit about what coaches do. For all we know, maybe there just there to give overall perspective, not nitty gritty shit.  Second of all, Polts was an accomplished player in another video game. Yes, he won't know the specifics of League, but he understands how teams operates. Interpersonal issues are just as important to control as strategies. Interpersonal issues can create collapses like the 2004 Lakers. There are a lot of great Coaches who never coached before. Repeared went basically from player to coach. Kkoma was basically the same. Some good NBA coaches didn't play a lick of basketball.  Tl;dr: Shit comparison."

leagueoflegends,JaqeyWasTaken,How the hell is Samira's 60% banrate okay?," Her windwall lasts for 1.25 seconds. That's barely anything. If she times it correctly, it blocks important projectiles. If she doesn't, she loses her best defensive ability for 20+ seconds. There's plenty of counterplay around that.  Compare that to Yasuo's windwall, which is quite large (especially late game) and lasts   seconds. In a teamfight, he's potentially blocking off 6-8 auto attacks from an enemy ADC... or forcing them to come into otherwise fatal range. Samira could use some tuning, I agree. But I don't think the wind wall is the biggest problem - or even a problem at all."

Definitionally. No matter the meaning or consequences in reality.  Re: Republic vs. Democracy. Yeah, this is a line I've heard trotted out for a lot longer than two months. It's the perfect response when you tell them Trump and Republicans are acting against Democracy and abusing their power. Because that is a very true thing that has been happening for a long ass time. Yeah, you could say we're technically a Republic (by this time, they have derailed and won the only way they can), but the ideal of Democracy as a country run by the people is the point. There's no idealism there for them. It's a word they use to feel like they are part of the American Dream, like Freedom, Liberty, etc. I've had a regular far right talk radio listener just repeat words like that in conversation, after minutes or hours of losing on point after point. He'd also quite often bring up The Constitution without ever having read it and without addressing why he didn't give two shits about the Emoluments Clause if he held The Constitution as sacred.  This is the rot that has sunk deep into America, and I'm not sure anything can be done about it. They are told what to believe, and they happily follow.  It is simple for them, and it is what they are taught. The Evangelical support for Donald Trump is no accident. He is who they are, and they are taught to obey a cruel ruler unquestioningly."

atheism,Wild_Kindheartedness,"Back to holding my position as an atheist, and this time I'm in the Strong Atheism category. [Warning - This post is a bit deep so I would advise against reading this if you are new to this subreddit]"," Well all mammals have a ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which processes risk, decision making, self control, and plays a role in morality. Also elephants have been shown to mourn. And whales have a lot of unique behaviors when a calf dies, too. Personally I think morality is imposed on us by selective pressures. And death is something that's occurs for pretty much every species. So I'd suspect that many species are aware of death to some degree. Frankly I think there's a very logical and straight forward reason for a fear of death. Its a fear of the unknown. Not to mention we don't even have to conceptualize it to fear it. Animals that fear death are more likely to take steps to avoid it. So its probably just selected for that way, whether we have a reason for fearing it or not. The reasons probably came after, kind of like the reasoning for our emotions. We feel the instinctive impulse first, and then we try to rationalize it after the fact."
atheism,BigBiscuits2,"Can I get some help compiling some evidence against the existence of God? All you need to do is comment a piece of evidence, or an intriguing question someone religious can't logically answer."," You've got this backwards.  People claiming 'a god exists' are the ones that must provide the evidence.   If I claimed 'Bigfoot exists', is it up to you to provide evidence that he doesn't?  No, it's up to me to provide the evidence he does.  And until I do, you are perfectly correct in not believing he exists."

As John Lennon said , ""God is a concept by which we measure our pain"". From my perspective, God is an attempt by our species to scour the world for meaning. Also, it was most likely the very first question that our species asked to themselves, because isn't asking the question ""Does God exist"" the same as asking ""Does the universe care about me?"". So exactly, you are right! As Hitchens said, it's like 'waking up one day and realising the whole universe is about me', which isn't actually comforting but in fact completely arrogant and ugly."

I didn't fit in with black girls, white girls, Hispanic girls, etc.  No one had hair like mine or features like mine. I was bullied constantly for looking different.  And I didn't come from a supportive family that lifted me up and made me feel beautiful either.   So it was like rejection from both the dominant (white) culture, my own culture, and other cultures.   I think some white women are beautiful indeed, but you're right...racism has definitely influenced a lot of people to believe that they are the ""most"" beautiful and it causes many young girls who are not white to develop low self-esteem, especially those who don't grow up with caring families.   It was interesting too that you mentioned Marilyn Monroe.  She is someone I admire for her beauty and her talent as well as her struggles, but her image is also problematic.  She wasn't a natural blonde...she was a cute girl with brown hair and crooked teeth until 1946, when men in Hollywood decided to make her famous.  So even the ultimate white female icon didn't start out as a ""blonde bombshell"" yet she is still revered as the most beautiful woman in the world.  I've never heard of any WOC who are fawned over the way she is, except Beyonce and Halle Berry in her prime, and even they probably won't be as famous decades after death like Marilyn.  Then you look at somebody like Dorothy Dandridge, a Black actress who died a couple of years after Marilyn, and hardly anyone remembers her anymore.  It's sad but it shows how WOC are often pushed aside.   I hope no young girl today feels the way I did growing up.  It's terrible to feel that you can't be beautiful or worthy unless you are white, or if you don't have straight hair or light eyes or any of the things that are pushed as ""ideal"".   Thanks for having the balls to write about this...most people won't talk about it as honestly as you do.  "

ToxicAMWF,,Theory: The Decline of the Value of the WF in the Future and their Backlash Against Non-White XF's Rising Status - Possible Major Shifts in the Female Dating/Desirability Landscape," Thank you so much! I'm glad you enjoyed it! :) And no worries, this isn't an Asian woman-only space. Our mods are made up of a Black woman, Latina woman, Blasian woman, and even an Asian man who agrees with what is expressed in this sub. You are definitely more than welcome to participate, and it's actually highly encouraged that people come and participate if they want to. Definitely agree with this to a certain extent. Every group has in-group-out-group bias against people who they consider outsiders, and this extends to every race in this country, whether it's white, black, Asian, Latinx, etc. The issue really goes back to the ""power"" component of racism that is disproportionately in the hands of white people. As long as power is in their hands, they can uplift themselves over everyone else, including beauty standards. The good news is that the power disparity between whites and non-whites is beginning to decrease, albeit slowly, on a domestic and global scale. Also, in recent years, there's been an aesthetic that's been pushed around, as noted by many keen media observers, that the ideal of feminine beauty these days is no longer the blonde, blue-eyed aesthetic that many of us older folks grew up with when we were younger, and is now a ""racially ambiguous"" aesthetic. It's a recent development, so we will see whether it will last, but it would be interesting to see how young men and women who grow up in this environment during their formative years will change with regards to their evaluation of physical beauty compared to those of us who are older who grew up in a much different environment. If there is a significant change, then it will prove what all of us have suspected all along, and that the preference for white women in the past and present is more socially engineered than inherently preferred."

It‚Äôs a much closer race if the hot chocolate was made with milk, but the win still goes to chocolate milk.

The exception relating to rape/sexual assault is also questionable given the low reporting rate by men. The bottom line is that men have a much   reason to be fearful before leaving their homes than women simply because, statistically, they are much more likely to be victims of random violent crime.   The reason men are less fearful is because men are expected to be brave and fearless. Men who aren't brave are mocked and ridiculed as cowards.  Men being fearless is not a benefit they enjoy, it is a burden they are expected to bear."

leagueoflegends,JaqeyWasTaken,How the hell is Samira's 60% banrate okay?," Lillia is low WR, but she has an oddball playstyle. Until Worlds, people preferred her suboptimal AP burst build; she is designed to be an AP skirmisher. She has a unique clear that requires practicing, and is weak pre-6 so you don‚Äôt want to gank until then unless it‚Äôs free. In the current soloq meta that prefers strong early-mid game champs and strong gankers, it‚Äôs really easy to play her incorrectly, especially when your team is flaming you for not ganking or failing ganks. She‚Äôs positional-reliant like Aurelion Sol, and needs to be able to dodge skillshots and weave in and out of fights. Her R also has some nuance to it; it‚Äôs a delayed CC so you need to know when people can‚Äôt fuck it up for you. She‚Äôs also not the best at taking objectives without some backup. Her early levels can be extremely strong with the right teammate, but that still requires a good duo.  She‚Äôs basically always gonna have a low WR unless she‚Äôs busted. In the hands of a person familiar with her, she will just gain a lead by outfarming and due to her MS you can‚Äôt do much without hard CC. Definitely got the skill expression kit going on, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs weak. Just takes some practice. Actually getting AP brusier items next season will probably give her a bump too."

We added ""In God we Trust"" to our money,  and ""One nation under God"" to the pledge. It went through the 70's-90's and caused the ""Satanic Panic""  of the 80's.

A classic is that Columbus tried to convince the Catholic missionaries not to convert the Native Americans to Christianity because then it would be immoral to enslave them. Which is bad enough by itself, but if he was truly a Christian himself he‚Äôd have firmly believed that not converting them had a much bigger impact than just not being able to enslave them.  It meant purposely condemning them to Hell by denying them salvation.  Because he personally needed someone to do work for him. Edit:  There‚Äôs another story about Columbus, one that they actually used to tell at the time.  The story was that if you wanted to follow where he went when he sailed off to some other island or whatever, all you had to do was follow the trail of Native American corpses in the water.  Because he‚Äôd kidnapped so any of them and was abusing them so horrendously that they were dying regularly and just getting thrown overboard.

ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"The Irony Of Hapa ""Race Realists"""," Ahh, I see. How interesting. Thanks for this piece of info, I would've never known haha! Hmmm. With regards to discrimination against Asians.... I think it will depend on the circumstances. If the current government in the US which espouses cosmopolitanism, egalitarianism, neoliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism is still around during and at the conclusion of this hypothetical war between the US and China, then yes, the current trend of Asian women playing the ""honorary Aryan"" companion to white men will continue, if not get further exacerbated due to the pressures of the environment. The discrimination against Asian men will get a lot more severe, as you've said. If it doesn't exist any longer, or if it is undergoing massive instability, then there may be a wide range of possibilities for the Asian community. The circumstances are different today compared to during the 1940's when the Japanese were sent to concentration camps. Back then, America was a young, rising empire which came fresh off of its victorious acquisitions of former Spanish colonial territories, was predominantly white with a severely repressed black minority, boasted booming technology and industrial sectors, and was rapidly recovering itself into virtually the only country in the world who gained the vast majority of wealth post-World War II. Today, it has an overly extended military presence around the world that it cannot expect to sustain in the future, massive wealth inequality, an ever-climbing national debt, a more heterogeneous racial makeup which is unsurprisingly leading to increased tension between whites and non-whites, and a government that is getting more and more dysfunctional and irresponsible by the day. The United States can comfortably be considered to be in the ""decline"" phase of empire, and when that happens, usually divisions that have already existed in society could potentially get extremely exacerbated even further along the lines of ideology, race, religion, etc. and may cause sectarian conflict. This could obviously open up a wide range of scenarios and thus, different outcomes for Asians, which I won't get into because they're too many and unpredictable. Either way, these are all hypotheticals we're talking about. I have no confidence that the Asian community as a collective whole will know what to do with themselves in times of crises. While I've met a lot of Asians who don't like Trump, they tend to view him through the lens of white liberalism and think that by just voting him out, the problems of the US will be solved and it would just go back to like it was. And that's just these folks, I'm not even counting the people who still, to this day, do not follow politics at all. The very idea of the effects that war with China or any other Asian country, or the possibility of violent conflict within the United States among competing groups has never even crossed their minds one bit, and a lot of them are still stuck on planning their lives around the ""American dream"" concept that even white people are scoffing and laughing at. It's ridiculous, because every other racial group is up to speed and knows what's up. Asians are the only ones who are still mentally stuck in the goddamn 20th century, and are not prepared at all. It is hilarious in a tragic way. ‚Äã"

ToxicAMWF,Throwaway38371729,I don't understand the point of this sub?," Says the person who can only say ""white-worshipping Chans"" and play the whataboutism card every chance you get. Honestly, you might have a valid point in all that rage, but blindly attacking literally every AM just because he's an AM makes you seem more like an edgy extremist than a woke person. When you go after AM who wants to root out white supremacy, you're losing allies. You don't   to assume that everyone who's not foaming at the mouth to literally call every WF a racist, is automatically tolerant of the systemic racism. But go ahead and flip shit anyways.  Ironically, you're trying to tarnish WF with the sarcastic #AsianMansBestAlly, while countering with ""should've gone with non-WF instead"" - The optics is really that you're bitter over some AM not dating you. Then again, you call every one of us a ""white supremacist in Asian face"" and don't think of us as humans anyways, so it's also possible that they might've rejected you  , not you  . There could've been a discussion on internalized racism, the pressure of conformity in diasporic areas that lack Asian presence, or even how XF are also capable of promoting emasculation of AM which drives AM deeper into isolation and dispair. But no, it's always the same song and dance about how AM are literally Hitler and nothing further. Tired old act.   It's no wonder OP didn't get the point of this sub when half of it is filled with your attack against anything AM, or why some people thought you're a white troll.  Did you just belittle Black Americans by perpetuating the language and speech patterns of blackface minstrelsy?"
ToxicAMWF,GotTheseChansShook,"Eurasian woman says, ‚Äúall Asians I've ever known have put my appearance up on some sort of pedestal based on my racial mixture, especially the men, so I've been conditioned to think that white = right‚Äù", This Eurasian woman is literally saying Asian males enforce the belief that white is right. This is not surprising as all since AMs are literal white supremacists in Asian face.
ToxicAMWF,Throwaway38371729,I don't understand the point of this sub?," Aw... did I hurt your po widdle feelings. I‚Äôm not going to sugar coat my words so white worshipping Chans can feel better about themselves, you can fuck right off with that. What I call AMs is not even close to the slurs AMs have hurled at black, Asian and other non white women. Chans are always the aggressors then want to play the victim. FOH!"
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"The Irony Of Hapa ""Race Realists"""," Wow. This is excellent! Applause all around, especially about the various ways that biracial people can look. Genetics are really a massive toss-up, and any argument to prove the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù genetics of AMWF vs WMAF really mirrors the same process that scientific racism was developed by Westerners during the 19th century. This should‚Äôve provided some context against that argument, but based on the downvotes you‚Äôre getting, it seems Facts < Feelings for these idiots lol I didn‚Äôt even know that they used to list the first wave of Chinese immigrants as ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù, nor about the classification going on in South Africa. I hear a lot of Hapas and even some full Asians who have brought up the hope that Asians could eventually be included in the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù category the same way Jews and Italians were eventually included, but it seems like it was never going to be the case ever, and probably will never be the case I do think the rising wave of Sinophobia definitely is going to be a real cause for concern among not just people of Chinese descent but for anyone who could look like they pass for East Asian/have ‚ÄúMongoloid‚Äù features. Based on what I‚Äôve read from various history and political science books, usually during times of war with an enemy nation, the minority group in America that shares the same ethnicity as the enemy state tend to try their hardest to ‚Äúprove their loyalty and Americanness‚Äù by enlisting in the military to fight against their motherland and later on, attempt to assimilate massively into American society by getting rid of their language, food, other cultural markings, and even engage in massive interracial/inter-ethnic marriage with whites/Anglos to assimilate more easily into society. This is also the reason why you see so many Asian Americans push the trope of hating being asked where they‚Äôre from, as it is an attempt to highlight their ‚Äúforeignness‚Äù and it impedes them from progressing along with their ‚ÄúAmericanization‚Äù. This happened with the Japanese-American and Italian-American communities during World War II, and German-American communities during World War I and II. I can just imagine the sight. For the Asians who hate interracial dating with whites on either side, if you think the Asian outdating rate is bad already, it may skyrocket if real physical conflict ever arises between the US and China. Based on your knowledge, what do you think would be the new race reordering, as you say, in the future? What key factors should we look out for that may affect this new order? I have a few ideas, but I am really interested and curious to hear your thoughts on this. And no worries! I understand, we‚Äôre all busy people. Really appreciate reading this, I really enjoyed it! :)"

leagueoflegends,728k,share your unpopular opinions," The difference between Janna/lulu is still huge. Janna‚Äôs Q is mechanically unique to her as a supp and different to lulu‚Äôs polymorph in the sense that it provides a different type of cc that in some situations works better than Lulu‚Äôs polymorph. Both Janna‚Äôs Q+ult and lulu‚Äôs polymorph+ult are very valuable and different abilities to each others‚Äô that bring different things to the table in pro play. But sona has no proper place in pro play. She has a lot of poke and some healing, yes but she doesn‚Äôt excel at any of those in particular. If you want poke, just pick zyra or karma. If you want heals, just pick soraka or nami. She at least had her ult, but it was still not good enough of an ability to pick in pro play (again, outside of cheese lanes) but it was at least somewhat unique to her. But now if you want a sona-type ult, you just pick seraphine. The trade off with the fact that it‚Äôs not instant in sona‚Äôs is 100% worth it for sera. She‚Äôs competitively viable. And if it was just that, the ultimate alone, then it‚Äôs whatever. But the rest of her kit mirrors sona‚Äôs as the cherry on top: In the competitive scene seraphine just does what sona does but better. The extra dmg or healing sona might have doesn‚Äôt matter there, because that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôd pick sona for (because again, you‚Äôd pick other champs for poke or healing).  Soloq is a diff story of course, people there can‚Äôt respect her poke and don‚Äôt punish her squishiness so she‚Äôll always be a decent soloq pick imo. But in the pro scene sona will just be in sera‚Äôs shadow and now it‚Äôs hard for her to be reworked due to her kit being too similar. A bit like the udyr situation, except in his case it‚Äôs due to his ultimate skin"

But the excellent providing AM don‚Äôt want the poor tanned farm girl from the countryside of Thailand. She has a much better shot at securing the bag from a WM. Not really. AMs have always had white fever and dream of dating WF but because barely any WF want them, they end up ‚Äúsettling‚Äù for AW. Vast majority of AM are Chans and would run over their own families for a shot at whitey. I agree that AM are white worshipping and are sexually jealous of WM. "

ToxicAMWF,Throwaway38371729,I don't understand the point of this sub?, It‚Äôs self serving for you to hide behind Asian women and blame them for all the anti blackness when Asian males are even more anti black.
ToxicAMWF,Throwaway38371729,I don't understand the point of this sub?," Yeah no. AMBF and BMAF both make 0.3% of AM and  0.9% of AF marriages (2010).

ToxicAMWF,Throwaway38371729,I don't understand the point of this sub?," I disagree, actually, and I think you're letting your own personal biases cloud your judgement. AM are pretty objective when it comes to WF attractiveness. I hardly ever see AM with unattractive WF. Lmao most AM are excellent providers. As you very well know, it goes a lot further than than that. It has a lot to do with colonialism. It has a bit to do with the status boost and social mobility offered by WM in a white supremacist society that degrades men of color. I think you'll find that AF with racist WM outnumber AM with racist WF by a long shot Yeah you seem pretty vindictive. Many (though not all) attractive/successful AM eventually learn through experience to not bother with their hot/successful AF counterparts because they are mostly Lus anyway. White beauty standards and AMWF pedestalization result from white supremacy and the failure of AM to outcompete WM."

That‚Äôs cause in the eyes of AM, a 3/10 WF is a 7/10 just for being white. Nothing is unattractive about a whitey to Asian Chans. We‚Äôve posted a gazillion ugly WF in AMWF here. Women generally look better than males. Males are more shallow than women and go more for looks while women care more about financial stability and if a man can provide for the family. Poor women from developing Asian countries marry WM in western countries so they can live in a developed country.  And there are plenty of AM with racist WF No, but that‚Äôs what AM do to AW. AW are plan z for AM that couldn‚Äôt get WF while they ignore the existence of black and hispanic women. Wrong. The AM consensus is that AMWF is the gold standard and should be what all AM strive for while AMBF, AMLF and AMAF is genocide of AMWF. AMs have never been ‚Äúloyal‚Äù to AW in the first place. AMs are only as ‚Äúloyal‚Äù as their options as in AMs deserpately want to date white but can‚Äôt because 99% of WF find you Chans ugly as shit. Now this I can agree with.

Fans are hoping that these pictures will get the attention of T1 management and the Korean eSports press."," To add a bit of context and personal opinion... That's very questionable. To start with when I've heard that comparison it's mostly due to how ingrained in the system racism is in america and how the problem is usually treated in such an hypocritical and populist way. You are talking about radical people in radical enviroments, it's not the same. Football fans can sometimes be extremely toxic and attract that kind of people. And even there this are conducts that are severely frowned upon by most of the sports community and the press. Which is not to say there is no racism here, but personally I just kinda get the impression that there is something a bit rotten about the issue in america. Not just how the racism manifests itself, but the also sometimes very close minded and judgy aproach it's taken to combat it. That last thing it's not exclusive from america either but more exagerated, I guess. Kind of a worrying trend that doesn't take us anywhere. Granted though, I'm from Spain and, for all the long list of problems the country has (and toxic football fans are definetly part of them) we are probably one of the less racist places to live in both Europe and out of it. Sometimes when we see racism from our own brands of national shit we tend to forget it, but data still shows that we are pretty decent in that regard here. So I don't know, maybe if I lived somewhere else I would think diferently. That's not to say there isn't racism huh, of course, it's part of life, but I'd say that it manifests more in classism that anything else. I feel like what you will see in Europe is mostly jabs at Stereotypes from every country which sometimes turns into a bit more of a serious racism (OR classism, I've heard not so nice things about how spanish get treated in UK by SOME people, for example) but usually it's lighter than that. The whole Gypsy thing is kind of a Pandora's box that I definetly won't open here. I have 0 things against them per se, and to be honest I haven't had problems with them myself, but atleast here most of the criticism comes from the fact that they have very closed up comunities that don't usually respect civic rules that much. There are a lot of examples that could be talked about but this is not the place. Still, it's not nice to generalize. And then again, this can be a bit of a confirmation byas, like when you say ""spanish, or french, or italian people in lol, uff, so toxic"". And then you kinda realize that only people who don't give a fuck about spamming the chat full of messages most of the team won't understand are the one's that give you proof of where they are from. In a similar way I'm sure that there are a lot of lower profile gypsies that don't give any problems and that's harder to see, so... I don't know. Regarding Koreans btw and their hatred for LS... I mean... LS is controversial, doesn't have to have any relation to it but I have to be honest, every time I've watched Cowsep play in Korea every now and then he has complained about how they treat him for being a westerner, so I'm not sure it's not part of the equation either."

There are times he was, and times he wasn't.

Yes he was told to back of the God thumping by Bob and Silky.  Feel free to read the history.  I am not rewriting anything.   And as for you getting kicked out of a NA meeting for not having a higher power.  I am not going to call you a liar, but I am highly suspect of this.  This goes against all principles and if that group had any real member they would have chased you out and admonished the group conscience.  I hear many people speak of these happenings and in ten years have yet to see it happen with my own eyes.  I share of not having a high power quite often and never once have I been asked to leave, I have only been told to keep coming back.  I am not saying it didn't happen, but if I were in that group, they would have had a very angry member on their hands making sure you got the support you needed.

atheism,dreamdiode,12 Step Programs are religious pseudo-science rather than clinically-proven interventions for addictions," It depends on the meeting you attend, really, which are kept insular and self sustaining by design. You can walk into a creepy collared shirt meeting where you're expected to bring a Bible, or you could walk into a little home group that's really just a few people trying to help and support each other. There's even a Wiccan AA group not far from me. They're all so different it's mind boggling. In fact, I think the true reason for AA's global success is that Bill Wilson, love him or hate him, was an organizational genius. We've all heard the 12 steps, but the real magic is the 12 Traditions, by which all AA meetings must abide. They are: 1 ‚Äì¬†Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity. 2 ‚Äì¬†For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority ‚Äì¬†a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants, they do not govern. 3¬†‚Äì The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking. 4 ‚Äì Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups, or A.A. as a whole. 5 ‚Äì¬†Each group has but one primary purpose ‚Äì to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers. 6 ‚Äì¬†An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise,¬†lest problems of money, property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose. 7 ‚Äì¬†Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions. 8 ‚Äì¬†Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers. 9 ‚Äì¬†A.A., as such, ought never be organized,¬†but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve. 10 ‚Äì¬†Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues, hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy. 11 ‚Äì¬†Our public relations policy is based upon attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films. 12 ‚Äì¬†Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities. TLDR: AA is heavily decentralized, and furthermore, is directly barred from becoming centralized. Each group is responsible for itself alone, including financially. There are no membership requirements other than the desire to stop drinking. A common complaint about AA is that it's a cult, and to the complainants credit, there is no shortage of god-talk and culty meetings. However, the decentralization, anonymity, and lack of a clear leadership structure makes it the opposite of a cult, organizationally speaking."

These are anathema to debate, because femme/bipoc perspectives are not open to debate, that's the whole problem!  Sensitivity is setting aside close-minded judgements and argument out of ignorance to open for enlightenment. Come together not create adversarial circumstance. Women's & BIPOC experiences are valid despite what anyone else thinks, perceives, or believes. Please recruit female leaders of color to advise you on constructive ally behavior. Buy the quick read, ""Yes, I'm Judging You"" and make your whole committee read it. Then reimagine your program. I recommend reaching out to national womens (Black Women's Caucus, League of Women Voters, The Women's March, NARAL) for connections to local leaders with existing programs you can model or import.  PLEASE don't slap a cookie cutter program on this, dig in and make some ground-breaking change!!! Good Luck!!!!"

atheism,Heinzelboss,About Bidens speech: Why is America so religion-centered?," I believe it is ok for someone to say things such as what Biden has. He does go to church. I do draw the line on ANY politician who uses only religion or courts religious groups in the campaign. There is no room for anyone to force one set of ideals, based on one corrupted version of that faith (which is what trump was gunning for because the gullible masses believe in a deity and will ignore that which goes on in the background as long as he keeps a fake preacher pushing the garbage) and this is very well spelled out in out constitution. People can believe what they want, but they need to keep it out of other people's faces."

atheism,Sleepinator2000,Awkward silence on the religious forums.," But clearly a lot of our fellow atheists ARE elated, based on the number of accolades we have seen, and probably for good reason.  Biden's speech included words like ""building on a bedrock of science"", but he also had some Bible quotes as well, so perhaps reasons for celebration for religious people. It just stands in stark contrast to me, because I assumed that everyone internationally knew Trump was a wack job con-man, but apparently that wasn't as true for those of faith. Am I wrong?"

leagueoflegends,thelostnomad_01,K/DA All Out Evelynn can be free in Garena," Hey man I answered this in one of the comments already. I don't know. I'm in the middle of the event myself and won't know if I needed to complete all four weeks to get the grand prize. But let's apply some logic shall we? Consecutive wins is a one-off mission that automatically ticks off 1/2 of the grand prize requirements upon completion. I assume that if we only need one or two  weekly missions for the grand prize, I would have ticked off the second requirement already. But. It's not the case for me yet. Do note that grand prizes are claimable after Nov 9 at which point I have NO idea if they count only partially completed weeks. SINCE it's a daily mission event, however, I would assume that you would have needed to log in to and play the events for the specific time frames like every other daily log in event in Garena that has historically been produced.  My bet is that it's a 4-week completion but I am not Garena or riot games. I posted what I know from the client and I can't give you the answers ya'll are asking for because I don't know myself and it would be kind of weird for those of us who are in the middle of the event to give answers we don't know ourselves. I suggest emailing garena or riot or whoever else has a more official standpoint on the event if you want clear and concise answers. We're fellow redditors and have no obligation to answer you. Sorry but you started the comment off on the wrong foot implying we were hoarding the answers but we're not. Personally I also don't know.

Their heroes are so much more diverse and interesting looking than champions in League of Legends.

lgbt,Kelmo7,Hate has no place in this USA," The sitmulus check is a very non-partisan idea. If anything, the democrats definitely wanted more stimulus for everyone than Trump, not less. The idea that Tump is getting rid of mortgages isn't based in reality.   Ending lockdown is a bad idea. We've 1/5th of the worlds covid cases with only 1/20th its population. Other countries with reasonable covid responses have had numbers that aren't as bad.    The idea that Trump was trying to get rid of gang members wasn't based in reality.

The woman would take full responsibility if she carries to birth (or obviously she could give up for adoption or something). Assistance should be provided to the women and children these men are literally fucking over. So maybe child support/financial assistance should then be funded by these mens rights groups. Oh wait, no that's not what these groups are getting at. They think the woman should HAVE to carry his offspring to birth. Oh right AND many men like to control women (think about all those creepy father-daughter grad photos where the dad is holding a shotgun or something) generally with judgements over her purity and virginity as basis of worthiness. Sex is supposed to be transactional, and only benefit men, I keep forgetting. I have an idea, call it a men's tax - every man can pay back the average wage difference that exists between men and women, and that money can be used to empower women and children who are forced into subjugation by selfish men. I mean, women will still have abortions. Sometimes all it  takes is a few cups of tea, some herbs... we'll just have to go to our local witches and wise women to learn, instead of getting these done in male dominant institutions.

Honestly whites don‚Äôt have to worry about Asians overtaking them because mentality wise, Asians are completely colonized and love licking the arses of their white masters.

ToxicAMWF,GotTheseChansShook,"First Presdient of South Korea married an unattractive white translator, ChanMasculinity is calling her a ‚Äòbeautiful foreigner wife‚Äô."," Syngman Rhee was a puppet dictator installed by the US government who played a key role in repressing his people during the US occupation during the Korean War to bring South Korea ‚Äúcloser to the US.‚Äù During his reign, he cracked down on political dissent from his citizens about the occupation using assassinations and imprisonment, and instituted re-education camps to make them more amenable to his policies and close relationship with the US military. Millions starved during his rule. It eventually led to him dissolving term limits, allowing him to rule indefinitely. His oppressive rule finally came to an end when his efforts to rig the April 1960 election of that year for himself and his vice presidential pick, Lee Ki-Poong triggered a massive protest called the April Revolution which eventually led to his resignation. Being the spineless, white-worshipping coward that he was, he fled with his white wife via help with the CIA to Honolulu, Hawaii, leading the rest of his life in relative comfort all the way to his death, never giving a damn about his country or his people ever again. The idiots who gas up these AMWF couples unconditionally without even considering the harm that the AMs have caused to their own people are just as self-hating as the AFs who go off and support AF Lus like Amy Tan, and care more about getting the approval of white people instead of defending their own people.  Look through the record of history, and you will actually find a lot of AMs married to WFs who serve white supremacy. Francis Fukuyama, Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa, John Walk and more have all done just as much harm to the Asian community in Asia and abroad through their support and approval of harmful policies and strategies supported by the white military establishment. AMs with WFs have just as much a guilty record of being lapdogs for white supremacy as AFs with WMs. In fact, if you search on Wikipedia and looked up a list of all the appointees that Donald trump had made during his administration, there is a sizeable portion of them who are AMs and AFs married to white people. And no, it‚Äôs not lopsided to one couple, both AMWF and WMAF are represented equally. And ironically enough, AMAF is nowhere to be found. So for all the people who say that an AM cannot get privilege or status through marriage with WF as opposed to AF, that is just plain, unadulterated GARBAGE. There definitely is a status boost associated with marrying WFs, and in some elite political circles, WMs actually encourage AMWF, as it would hurry up the assimilation process for the Asian community, and thus, remove the threat that an established, multi-generational Asian community could pose to white dominance.  So no, to all the Chans and Lus who go off and say your relationships with your white significant others is ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù and ‚Äúdecolonized‚Äù, it is absolutely not. If anything, every other type of couple with Asians, even with other Asians, is much more progressive and subversive than AMWF and WMAF."

It‚Äôs bad enough AM only praise WF but they actively and viciously any woman that isn‚Äôt white. ‚ÄúIgnorant‚Äù. Why do Chans like you refuse to hold your white masters accountable for anything? It‚Äôs racism, point blank. This is just another excuse you‚Äôve pulled out to justify your white fever. Why dont black women get the same treatment? Why is that whenever a BW is caught doing something to an Asian, Asian males quickly jump to attack her and use the incident as justification for why he doesnt date BW when they never do the same for WF? And while AW should be aware that WM are not worthy mates by default for being white, to say that AW are all self hating Lus because WM is an option isn't a great look.  Chans need to be coddled and given the benefit of the doubt while Lus are attacked, harassed and abused by your Asian male ‚Äòactivists‚Äô. Let‚Äôs keep the same energy."
ToxicAMWF,GotTheseChansShook,Daily reminder that the only ‚Äúactivism‚Äù Asian males have ever done in their sad pathetic lives is crowdfund racial fetish AMWF porn," This is where the messaging gets confusing to me again. First, I thought you meant there was praising for this AMWF that I'm referring to, not a totally separate individual. Secondly, we were (or at least I was) applauding the spirit of what she was trying to do as a mother - to support and foster her Hapa children's identity as they grow, and to remain constant. Exclusion and Othering are common problems that Hapas face, because their parents aren't even aware of those issues, yet here she is, saying that she will work along side her Asian husband on this issue. But you're saying that this is a clear example of a narcissist WF, and no one should support her. Caring about innocent children one minute, but scrap it all if the mom is white...There isn't a clear message here. Meanwhile, the couple that   presented, the WF has shown narcissistic tendencies. Nobody is praising her (except her hardcore fans, which are mostly other WF and young teens). There's been a few instances where someone claiming to be an AM was applauding the guy for being so tall and fit and getting a white girl, and we all told him to gtfo with that incel Chan shit. I'm ready to go against someone who wants to perpetuate colonized mindset and systematic racism, but trashing WF for being WF when they are obviously trying break that cycle, isn't going to make any overall progress. I like when this sub showcases examples of racist WF and AM with internalized racism. But after a while, it feels like we're beating a dead horse: Basic Beckies are gonna Beck. We're not surprised that dumb white girls are going to be ignorant. And while AM should be aware that WF are not worthy mates by default for being white, to say that AM are all eunuch Chans because WF is an option isn't a great look.  I didn't expect the world. I wanted more people to join THIS fight. Some of us have went at it alone and got blocked, so we need the numbers to prove a point. Yes, that guy is a Chan, but we should at least try to wake him up instead of just tossing him to the side already. If he's not receptive to that, THEN let's forget him and put him on blast as an example to other AM who want to follow suit. Or at the very least, get a system in place for their Hapa kids to be more well-adjusted. I DO expect more from my fellow Asians who want to be involved in the activism. I think the primary goals of encouraging AM to get swole and have more sex are cringey and misogynistic. I'm not alone in this. We should be encouraging our AM to be more self-confident and find the Asian American approach to being a man, rather than usurping the colonized interpretation of toxic masculinity."
ToxicAMWF,GotTheseChansShook,Daily reminder that the only ‚Äúactivism‚Äù Asian males have ever done in their sad pathetic lives is crowdfund racial fetish AMWF porn," I told you that poster was a WF. You expect WF to hold other WF responsible when all they do is gaslight non whites whenever a whitey is being racist?  They‚Äôre right here.  Literally praise after praise after praise. Not   comment calling the narcissist WF out. Chans are salivating at the image of a WF with Hapa children. They don‚Äôt care if she‚Äôs racist or her AM husband is a Chan (cause they are one themselves). All that matters is having a WF wife and Eurasian kids. It‚Äôs a dream they all hope to achieve. We brought awareness. We contributed to the topic, we commented and highlighted the toxicity of the relationship. Keep in mind there‚Äôs only a handful of users on this subreddit while AznIdentity has thousands so where‚Äôs the activism from their end? Since you expect the world from us why don‚Äôt you have any expectation from your fellow Asian Chan activists? They‚Äôll label us jealous Asian females or racist white males. It‚Äôs a common accusation that gets thrown at us whenever we call out white worship and self hate in AM. Because that‚Äôs what we care about the most, how it effects innocent children. If the eunuch Chan wants to be abused and degraded by his white master, go right ahead. He made his bed, and now he has to lay in it."
ToxicAMWF,GotTheseChansShook,Daily reminder that the only ‚Äúactivism‚Äù Asian males have ever done in their sad pathetic lives is crowdfund racial fetish AMWF porn," Not exactly.

Literally haven't seen those posts or comments. You're acting like everyone was praising this video, when everyone agreed that she was trash and he's awful for playing along.  Except you might be confusing me with someone else? I've never used those hashtags, and you're confusing me with not frothing at the mouth whenever an AM shows up with the assumption that I must be a white-worshipping Chan. This is an extremely hot take that's not really helping whatever it is you want to happen. Especially if when you promote #AsianMansBestAlly.  Do you honestly think YOU'RE being a great ally to us? This is what I mean, the irony that you'll go 100% to just call ANY AM a ""Chan"", put words in his mouth, and believe that he must worship every white people; when at the same time, you could've engaged the WF and her Chan SO directly, but didn't have the energy to go beyond ""yeah, their hapa children, man..."""

Also sorry to hear about your aunt I hope she is doing okay whereever she is. Definitely dont  disagree with anything you've listed here but I think it's important to make distinctions between safe and unsafe abortions and their contexts because abortions done in countries where women's health is funded and fostered, the risk is verrrrryy minor, and even in developed countries states are allowed to undermine medical info for the sake of religious dogma so the distinction matters!!!  Outside of my own experiences with terminating, in Canada where I live, almost every mother I know has had an abortion. This tells me that in places where there is accessible  and compassionate care, having an abortion doesn't have to be a death sentence and in the majority of cases it is a minor procedure with no longterm physical effects.  Unsafe abortion is very real and unimaginably painful. But abortion doesn't have to be unsafe and we have to be aware of how we construe the risks involved for others."

Men don‚Äôt get special protection where they come out on top over the child and mother in terms of rights. Once there‚Äôs a pregnancy it‚Äôs the person carrying‚Äôs right to continue or not. If a child is born then it‚Äôs the responsibility of both parents to ensure it‚Äôs financial security to the best of their ability.

I see your point, but abortion isn‚Äôt always a pill. It impacts your life and changes your activities. if you get a D and C or curettage and suction and it can be done safely, but there are always risks. It‚Äôs far far less risk than carrying a pregnancy to term, but it‚Äôs not risk free. It‚Äôs still painful, not pleasant and risks further complications. It‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs right and should be absolutely destigmatized but it‚Äôs not a visit to the nail salon. To be forced into one because your partner doesn‚Äôt want to parent is torture. To argue that abortion is risk free isn‚Äôt really an educated stance, especially when we are directly comparing it to vasectomies which are less risk. They are the best option often, but not risk free. Definitely, definitely agree on more funding though, and this is not an argument that abortion shouldn‚Äôt be available, it should be easier to access to help avoid complications."

If you have sex, regardless of protection, there is a chance a child will be made. Unfortunately, that is incubated in someone else and it‚Äôs their choice to continue with it or not. Due to biology, men‚Äôs options are more limited in that sense. It‚Äôs not their body, so once fertilization occurs their choices are over. Pregnancy is not a grace period for a man to choose whether or not to be a parent, that train has left the station.

From the   (emphasis mine): My own aunt suffered fertility issues and other issues following an unsafe abortion that she had in her teens.  The point I'm trying to make: Abortions can be unsafe, which is why it is important to keep them legal and to regulate them so that they can be as safe as possible.

Before I was 10 years old, I had already gone to 15 funerals, all for people I did not know. I had to go to the hospital as my dad died from being attacked by prison guards, and I did not shed a tear. I only ever met him twice, and all I can remember is him buying a sandwhich from a vending machine in the visitation common room. My mother called me a monster for not being concerned for my fathers death.  ‚Äã My sister commited uninstall from life because she was diagnosed with Lupus (incurable autoimmune disease, genetic)  and Alopecia (immune system attacks hair follicles, causing random bald patches all over the body, even stuff like eyebrows, and facial hair for men in specific) and she was incapable of mentally handling the tons of pills she had to take to manage her medical issues.  I did not cry, because I barely knew her. I did cry over my regret for never taking the time to get to know her, but I did not cry over her death.  My grandmother just recently passed, and I did not cry. She was an alcoholic abuser who used to beat me with a metal studded belt for literally any or no reason at all, at any time day or night. I lived every moment in complete and utter fear of being attacked as long as I was in the house, so I spent as much time as possible outside.  I cried when my wife died. I literally starved myself to death because I had lost all motivation to live, because just before that I had lost my son as well. Pure luck that the caretaker of the property at my appartment complex noticed I was missing from the on-site gym (I was in there every day, then would go for a two hour run and come back, shower, and hang out in the pool. I was brought back to life (again, literally) at a hospital. Then they just let me go home, no mental health care or advisement for me seeking that help out myself. Then I ate myself into obesity and high-blood pressure. I was drinking three GALLONS of wine every day, and would always order two family boxes of pizza from Pizza hut. Has two large pizzas and an option for stuff like wings and breadsticks, or a pasta dish.  ‚Äã now I have lupus, and for the past two years I have been physically incapable of exercising, so my health is still declining, and there is actually nothing I can do about it until i can get my medicine and find other proper treatments to help manage my disease.  If you don't cry for somebody because they died, it is fine. Sometimes it takes a while to have the feelings set in, for you to accept that things happened and that you have to process.  Never let somebody make you feel bad just because you display your emotions differently. Loss and the resulting grief affect us all differently, and at different levels."

It's gaining traction on twitter. I don't know why you would assume all that. Right, this is what I mean. Like take that energy and help out the movement by providing meaningful support and suppressing real Chans and racists. If you just want to froth at the mouth whenever an AM just appears, and do literally nothing else but call people ""Chans"", then you do you.

I think Asian activists could work on broadcasting their activism better. The other unfortunate thing is that some ""activists"" are gatekeeping wokeness based on just doing something; and it's become a pissing contest on who is ""more woke"" for having done stuff. I know there was some ruckus when the porno was made, but I don't know that most of us were really relieved thought this was a giant leap in the movement. But the other funny thing is, I posted a AMWF couple from YouTube a few weeks ago, that is classically problematic, and I was ready to roll out with their personal information (that they've openly shared to the public). What I expected was a unified front to confront this couple, but I was met with a resounding ""meh"" and shoulder shrugs.

Feminism,MistWeaver80,"These same men would then derail feminist discussion by saying: if women want to have abortion right, men must be allowed to violate children's rights (terminate their parental responsibility)."," That's definitely where it gets morally grey for a lot of people, me included.   For me personally, if I were in that situation, I would rather not have a disinterested, bad father figure in my child's life.  But I also have almost always been able to work and get by, and I have a strong family support system.  Not everyone has those luxuries.    I think a lot of people also don't realize that abortion is a medical procedure that can be physically, mentally, and emotionally difficult for the woman.  It shouldn't be used as regular birth control.    Back to my personal thoughts, in a perfect world where both people have been open and honest about what they want and intend for the relationship (ie, no kids ever, I don't love you and don't want you to think I do, etc),  tried to prevent pregnancy and an accident happens, then yes a man should have the right to not be involved, although I think it speaks poorly of his character."
Feminism,MistWeaver80,"These same men would then derail feminist discussion by saying: if women want to have abortion right, men must be allowed to violate children's rights (terminate their parental responsibility)."," I think the problem here is the tension between:  a) men who don‚Äôt want to use birth control and are anti-abortion,  b) and the fact that the think that they should be able to have a no-consequences Get Out of Jail Free card while women have to hear the burden of carrying, birthing, and raising the child that they equally created.  Specifically, they had unsafe sex with the woman in question, and therefore had equal responsibility in conception; they‚Äôre NOT ok with the woman in question having an abortion, meaning that they want her to assume financial and parental responsibility over the child for at least 18 years; and yet they‚Äôre not willing to fess up to their crucial part in the conception of said child and provide support, which is an inherently self-serving and rather hypocritical attitude.  There‚Äôs some room for nuance here, certainly, and I definitely think that there are times when men absolutely have the/are in the right to terminate their parental rights, but I think this post really references the hypocrites described above."
Feminism,MistWeaver80,"These same men would then derail feminist discussion by saying: if women want to have abortion right, men must be allowed to violate children's rights (terminate their parental responsibility)."," But for most of the time? I mean they aren‚Äôt interested in taking absolutely any responsibility like birth control or parental responsibility, 
And the bonus they want to ban abortions! So isn‚Äôt that hypocritical? Atleast allow one! Either allow women to take their own decisions and responsibility about their own bodily autonomy or you take absolute (unfailingly) responsibility about pregnancy. You can‚Äôt decide to go on neither of the ways."

Feminism,MistWeaver80,"These same men would then derail feminist discussion by saying: if women want to have abortion right, men must be allowed to violate children's rights (terminate their parental responsibility)."," The decision for the termination of parental responsibility must be done within a definite time period, a little earlier than for how long abortion is legal for the specified region. Termination of parental responsibility after the specified time period would be deemed illegal. This would allow the mother to choose whether she wants to carry the responsibility of the child single handedly. Or she wills to terminate the pregnancy as a whole."
Feminism,MistWeaver80,"These same men would then derail feminist discussion by saying: if women want to have abortion right, men must be allowed to violate children's rights (terminate their parental responsibility)."," The issue is that he should have taken responsible steps to prevent pregnancy before it happened, rather than leaving the weight of it all on the woman.  There are so many men who don't want to use condoms or anything else, but also don't want to be responsible for the logical aftermath of contraceptiveless sex.   Obviously not all men, and there are women who lie about their birth control to ""trap"" men, but if both parties were honest and responsible, we'd have a much healthier society."

Feminism,MistWeaver80,"These same men would then derail feminist discussion by saying: if women want to have abortion right, men must be allowed to violate children's rights (terminate their parental responsibility)."," If they want to ban abortions, mandate vasectomy before marriage and after completing the family. Vasectomy is reversible, safe and doesn‚Äôt affect libido.  Because they are ones who pregnate women and start the whole struggle cycle.  This counter argument would give them a nice blow."
atheism,Heinzelboss,About Bidens speech: Why is America so religion-centered?," A good leader is strategic. His job is to quell an uprising of irrational trump supports and bible thumpers. Meanwhile he also has to send a message to the rest of the country that he is progressive and will listen to evidence. For this reason he spoke at length about science but ended with sentences to signal he hasn‚Äôt abandoned his faith.  This tightrope is essential for a country who is 70-75% Christian and of those, majority are extremely literal. Speaking as an atheist, I don‚Äôt feel resentment towards that. I know other would feel alienated. But I‚Äôve spent enough time leading teams to know that you gotta herd the kittens."

If it‚Äôs bad, then it‚Äôs a test, or perhaps a punishment (typically for allowing/tolerating something the person hates), or else will somehow lead to some kind of greater good, if not for you then for some other people you‚Äôll never meet or hear about but who surely exist because, you know, god‚Äôs plan."

As a believer I can say the Bible states that ""not even a leaf falls from the tree without God's consent"" - hence I believe Obama was placed or allowed by God, Trump was placed or allowed by God, and now Biden in the same way.
So there's my answer, yes we believe Trump was placed by God but also that God has allowed Trump to be removed.

atheism,Komirade666,"From Africa, cheers to you USA."," 1) You mean taking away the rights of those seeking asylum. Taking their children from them?

You besides his racist rants? You mean besides stopping travel from Muslim countries (who, BTW were not on the terror watch list and allowing travel from countries that are on the terror watch list)? You means besides being named the most divisive president in US history?  3) Then you are wrong. Almost every other country in the world has universal health care, paid for by taxing citizens. The costs in those countries are miniscule compared to the US. No other country has tens of thousands of people being forced to declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses.  The GOP has CLEARLY made it a priority to remove rights from others. The right to vote. The right to adopt if you are in a homosexual relationship. The right to a fucking fair trial if you are not a white male.  If you like Trump's policies, then you are a horrible human being.

unpopularopinion,Jackbeingbad,Gun ownership and no knock warrants shouldnt exist in the same legal system," Gonna have to stop you there.  So say there's a bad guy inside, he is heavily armed and likely to flee or attack.  If the cops just announce they are there, that guy has a pretty good lead to grab a gun and kill you or run away and kill someone else.  And you say announcing ""police!"" isn't enough.  Ok so what do you want them to do?  Knock on the door and have a friendly convo?  Yeah that doesn't work in the real world. Do you remember the Corrine Gaines case?  If not look it up.  Woman with severe antigovernmental agenda and mental illness got a traffic stop and then they put out a warrant for her because she never showed up to court for that.  The cops knocked on the door to have a friendly convo and give her the warrant like you want.  And she grabbed a shotgun and blasted away at the cops.  Which then lead to a standoff where she used her own small child as a human meat shield and both of them ended up shot with her dead.  Those cops could have very easily ended up dead and many times they do in other cases.   As another example of how these things can quickly turn.  Look at the Rayshard Brooks case.  Drunk guy passed out in a Wendy's drive thru.  He was absolutely kind and cooperative the entire time, so were the cops.  Until they went to cuff him and then out of the blue he became belligerent and violent punching the cops, wrestling them to the ground, stealing a taser and shooting it at a cop (which in Georgia is considered a deadly weapon under the law and very easily could lead to him getting ahold of a cops gun or hopping into a car and rushing off drunk and hitting someone)  This was all caught on body cam, surveillance, and cellphone footage.  Even people that seem so kind and cooperative can turn in an instant like that especially when they don't want to go to jail.  So many are brainwashed to believe that all cops will murder you and that just leads to more encounters like this where people fight and attack rather than just do what you have to do.  Even if you are wrongfully arrested you can sort it out later in court or at the jail.  You never win when you get violent.   ‚Äã I assume you are talking about the Breonna Taylor case here and though I agree what happened to her was sad, I don't think people set out to slaughter her or that anything evil was done here.  First off, her boyfriend was a known member of a drug ring and he was using her address to have drugs shipped to her which she then gave to him (confirmed by the post master)  They did have a warrant to search that house because of the post master evidence, surveillance showing her going to known crack dens, her boyfriend and ex boyfriend being known drug dealers and being at her house, etc.  She was NOT an active EMT at the time of her death.  She was NOT sleeping in bed when she was killed.  She was either standing behind her boyfriend or he used her as a shield.  They knocked and announced who they were but the boyfriend started shooting and hit one of the cops (body cam footage of all this has been released already) and so they other cops shot back as they have every single right to do.  Unfortunately Breonna got hit in the process.  It's tragic, but it happens.  If anyone is to blame it should be her boyfriend.  He didn't live there, it wasn't his home, he was a known criminal who roped her into all this, and then so easily threw her life away to avoid going to prison himself for his drug dealing crimes."

atheism,AmatuerIntellectual,"‚ÄúSpare the Rod, Spoil the Child‚Äù"," Its fair to disagree, but there's alot to unpack there... 1: Giving your kid a spank when they are acting out or grossly misbehaving doesn't mean you don't love them. Its your job as a parent to ensure they learn how/how not to act in a society. If you fail that as a parent you have failed your child and their future prospects. A quick smack on the ass is not abuse and im confused as to how one with any decent constitution can honestly make that comparison. 2: Punishing them without corporal punishment and focusing on emotional and mental tactics... how is that not abuse by your definition then? How do you square the two? 3: Your boss... thats not even near the same thing. A parent and an employer arnt equivalent in any capacity. I feel like your grabbing at straws here. 4: Not hitting others... so your saying that being punished as a child will make you confused as an adult about assault? I agree maybe if you were badly abused and ended up antisocial because of it then you may have a point, but again, that different then punishment.
My father raised us with corporal punishment. Was a farm kid, then a soldier, then a firefighter/paramedic... so his tolerance for bullshit was low as you can probably imagine. He would be quick and hard if we deserved it, but also taught us about honor, and helping others, its of to defend yourself or others but not to be the aggressor, etc. If you can't figure out the difference as an adult then I dunno what to say. 5: Pets? First off pets don't comprehend things in the same ways as humans, so kind of another false equivalent here. Second I have given my dog a smack a couple of times. For stealing food, to playing to aggressively with kids and other animals. And now she's a very sweet gentle dog. She plays well with other animals and kids. She hasn't stolen food in more than a year and that dogs runs to me everyday I get home with unconditional love and excitement. So again its fine if you disagree, im just confused about you merits on why, outside that you believe all physical contacts is abuse. And if thats the only position you hold then I dont think we are going to agree on this one."

Born with a 3rd degree hemorrhage on the brain and installed with a VP shunt, I also never had a night where I went to bed and expected to wake up the next day.  I've known both my own mortality and been warned of awaited beyond the grave since I was born. While I thought I was happy then, I realize now that religion was the biggest contributing factor to why I'm such an anxious mess now. The happiest day in my life was the day I lost god. The day that I knew I was a flickering flame of will in a vast universe here only to be an experience and hopefully make some other flickers burn a little brighter before I go out myself was the day I became free from religion. It was the day I found myself able to love the most... And the day I truly felt the pain of so many short little lives wasted on their heavenly crowns while they're told their whole lives that living with nothing is the holiest of all by people driving porches to their private helicopters to be flown to their private yachts.

ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"AMWF Shill: ""Asian Women Are The Ugliest Race"" #ToxicAMWF #AntiWoCRacism"," I just checked that sub. Whew what a trip. These guys are begging to get banned from Reddit. There's been an attempt to quarantine ""problematic"" subs like TheRedPill recently, and I know that for years there's been an attempt by a few AF users in the more mainstream subs to bring this to the attention of the Reddit admins. I think a combination of their complaints, plus the presence of this sub, for whatever effect it brought, did tamper down on the pro-AMWF, anti-AF rhetoric that was expressed in the AznIdentity/AznMasc subs, so it only leaves the more ""moderate"" pro-AMWF/anti-AF promoters. The problem is, you still have loonies like these out in the wild looking for a place to grind their axe. So they create spaces like these where it is pretty upfront and naked with its anti-AF sentiment, no holding back whatsoever. While some AM's will see the proliferation of these communities as a good thing, I would be a bit concerned if I were the mods of these AM subs. If these subs were to expand in size and popularity, and if there really is a big AM population that hates AF's in this manner, then it would only add more ammo to the AF's side that AM's exhibit toxic Asian masculinity. Combine this with the fact that the head mods of AsianAmerican have, in the past, reported these subs to AgainstHarassment or whatever that sub's name is, and the fact that subs like BlackLadies have set up an autoban for users that post in Hapas/AznIdentity, and they've got a pretty good case going to get rid of all of these subs in these categories. You combine all of the scrutiny of social media platforms for racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia, etc. under the era of #MeToo/Third Wave feminist that's been going on and it's looking like an increasingly hostile environment for subs like this. It's a tough spot for these AM's, and while they do discuss a plethora of issues that is truly not addressed on the liberal left that AM's are justified for being angry about, it is sad that it will be the dating aspect which will be the one that gets them in the end. Some may think it's just dating so it's not a big deal, but the discussion of dating in these AM subs is not just about dating strategies for AM's -   Women's issues, and more specifically WOC's issues, are increasingly becoming very big topics that the media is discussing right now, and frankly, based on the discussions from what I'm seeing, a lot of these AM's are underestimating how these discussions about dating will help them make allies, or if they don't want to make allies,  . We're not in the 1980's-1990's when the Democratic ""left"" and the Republican ""right"" is split between addressing the concerns of white liberal women while paying lip service to minorities, and the conservative, Christian right that wants to maintain the status quo. Political alignments are shifting as we speak from that model in the Trump era, where now minority women, especially black women, are now gaining a voice in feminist movements and in politics, and are using their platforms to publicly call out the injustices of not only white men, but also white women who have, for decades, used and betrayed WOC's to further their own status and well-being. The Democratic party, as a general whole, is slowly but surely becoming the party of POC's, and with the introduction of intersectional politics, while white women certainly have grievances such as the sexism they face from white men, there is a pretty solid understanding within these intersectional movements that white women are the second most powerful group after white men, and are just as guilty for being complicit with WM's in the discrimination that a lot of minorities face. White women are now finding themselves not being centered in the Democratic ""left"" as much as before, and they certainly don't have much of a place in the Republican party either. So it leaves a lot of them pretty confused as to who they want to support -   This may be the underlying reason why the vote was split 50-50 for the women in the 2016 election, even when they had one of their own, Hillary Clinton, being a strong contender for the presidency and Donald Trump being the asinine, sexist pig that he was. A lot of them are already realizing that despite having one of their own as a representative for the party, the party is slowly shifting away from solely their concerns. WOC's represent a variety of women from different races and backgrounds, so in terms of being able to truly relate to each other's experiences, it is difficult. But the one thing that unites all WOC's together is the two sources of their suppression in society: 1) white men who control all the levers of power against not just WOC's but all people that are not white and male, and have a distinctive role in abusing WOC's based on their race and gender and 2)  For AM's who wonder why it's not just AF's who are reacting badly against their pro-WF promotion, and also why BF's, LF's and all other non-white XF's are joining in the conversation, it is because of this particular role that WF's have played against us for centuries. It is more than just racial sexual jealousy. You are literally getting in bed and promoting the group of women who have endorsed physically torturing us, banning us from entering the country with their non-white men, subjugated us, enslaved us, supported having bombs thrown at us, supported policies that will starve us, taking away our children from us, and pretty much doing everything that white men have done, except they have a vagina instead of a penis. The only difference between WM's and WF's is that WM's are already in positions of power, and because of that, don't pretend like they're a friend of yours and they directly tell you that they're going to fuck you over, while WF's go off pretending that they're your friends just to use you until they no longer need you to get what they want from WM's, then join these same WM's to shit all over you anyways when you cross them. Both WM's and WF's have the same goals and want the same things, they just have a different way of going about it. This is the reason why BlackLadies banned users who post on these pro-AM subs. This is the reason why subs like ToxicAMWF exist. And this is the reason why, if these pro-AM subs continue the way they are, they will never gain the support of WOC's and their allies, and thus, will be ostracized from the work towards united resistance against white supremacy. Women of all races are getting a larger voice in politics, but especially women of color in recent years. We have now reached a point where  , and this is in no small part due to the united resistance of WOC's against the white supremacy of WF's. I see a lot of older AM's that explicitly promote AMWF who still operate under the old model of believing that WF's hold a stronghold in the Democratic liberal left, and therefore, association with WF's will lead to the uplifting of AM's. But I can definitely assure you, based on the developments of what I'm seeing on the left in recent years, that this is slowly crumbling away, and this strategy is a terrible move for AM's as WOC's and other MOC's are consolidating their power in the mainstream liberal left.

Another example is Trump 9th circuit judicial nominee Kenneth Lee, who has always been outspoken about issues pertaining to Asian American men and anti-Asian discrimination.

Samira isn't for me   she fills a very cool niche and she brings a new perspective to the story (Shuriman refugee who's culturally Noxian? Fuck yeah?). I feel like such a crotchety old man but I feel like we had such a cool time 2014-2016? 2017? with reworks + a variety of weird & unique champions being released even on the human side. There are some characters I   like released since then, but it's hard to deny that 2019's Sylas, Yuumi, Qiyana, Senna & Aphelios feel a lot ""safer"" than 2015's Bard, Ekko, Tahm Kench, Kindred & Illaoi. I can't imagine contemporary Riot releasing a champion like Kled or Bard, let alone giving those champions cinematics, in game teasers, et cetera and that's honestly a genuine shame."

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," To just expand on this thought: people consider human to be default/generic (obviously, as we are all humans‚Äîalthough this isn‚Äôt really true to real life, because humans are SUPER specialized animals). Because of this, game design convention often means they‚Äôre put into the category of the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù race, which in gameplay terms means they are often jack of all trades. You can usually play any human and class combination in a game. If you make humans the default, you can probably ensure everyone can play the class they want, without having to play a race they hate because of their stats. Thus, nonhuman races are usually more specialized. To use DND as an example: humans get a choice of stat or feat at the start of the game, so they can literally do whatever. Whereas you might, say, make a Tiefling more specialized with their high charisma, but poor strength. Or the orc who has high strength but bad intelligence.  Like, if you‚Äôre playing a halfling barbarian, you‚Äôre probably doing it for the flavor, because you‚Äôre gimping yourself on synergistic stats. Your barbarian would be much stronger if you chose an Orc, but if you really hate Orcs, a human barbarian is probably fine.  Humans are the floor, but they‚Äôre not the ceiling in game design convention."

It can seem like a competition, but I feel like the majority of students are honestly struggling. Yes, some of those issues are self-made. But you‚Äôre new to college and to a life outside of your parents‚Äô care.  I‚Äôm 19‚Äîa 3rd year student in college because my junior and senior year of high school was spent at a community college instead. I learned what happens when you don‚Äôt manage your time way back in fourth grade. I was lucky and learned early-on about myself and my study methods. And the thing is? School is still hard. I never really had a ‚Äòreal‚Äô freshman year to compare to my junior year in college, but I can promise that as you go along, classes and workloads get harder and heavier. Especially now, when a lot of us are 100% online and professors don‚Äôt know how to balance the workload.  I get that peers complaining about their issues, especially when a lot of it is caused by poor time management, can get annoying. But y‚Äôall are still learning! I‚Äôm only a year older than you, but I can say for a fact that a lot of my friends in freshman year are struggling simply because they don‚Äôt know how to budget their time. Give your fellow students some slack‚Äîwe‚Äôre all still kids! This is a time where you really find out who you are, and what kind of person you‚Äôre going to be. So what if they complain? There‚Äôs a lot to complain about! It‚Äôs 2020 for crying out loud! There‚Äôs one particular item in your post that I can‚Äôt get behind though. Ramen is... well, cheap and easy to make. It‚Äôs considered the cliche student food because of that. I ate a fuck-ton of instant noodles back at the dorms simply because I wasn‚Äôt used to being my own self-sufficient human being! Suddenly I had a whole household of me to run, and no one to help. I prioritized my grades over my health and chose easy foods over ones that took time and money I didn‚Äôt have. A LOT of students are in the same boat. I don‚Äôt know what your life is like, but I can guess you‚Äôve never been short on money if you can‚Äôt understand why copious amounts of ramen are consumed by students daily. It‚Äôs because it might just be the best option for some students that are struggling. Again, give your peers the benefit of the doubt and give them a break! We come from different backgrounds and have different privileges. Some of us really are surviving on instant noodles and a couple hours of sleep because we have other responsibilities. Jobs and clubs and life in general.  Also, I never drank. Never spent money on that kind of thing. You know what most of my money WAS spent on? Textbooks. Extra class fees. Access codes. From your post, I‚Äôm imagining you know only the tiniest sliver of the student body. Most of us are hardworking. We aren‚Äôt partying every night. I might‚Äôve stayed up late on the weekends more than once, but usually it was just an online game or two with friends before bed. Honestly, I‚Äôd take a look at the circles you run in and really stop to think about the people you surround yourself with. You don‚Äôt have to be a shut-in, but if these are the types of people you find you‚Äôre always around, maybe the issue also lies with you. Reach out more and find like-minded people you can really thrive with. Do some research and rethink what you‚Äôve written in this post. Maybe ask yourself why those ‚Äòcompetitions‚Äô exist, or why those cliches are common. Branching out might really help you gain a new insight into your peers (people you might be spending the next 4+ years with!).  But really though, just be understanding. If you don‚Äôt like that type of conversation, politely remove yourself from it. You can be annoyed, but I promise letting your annoyance go instead of dwelling on it will do wonders for your mental health. (Also, the music you listen to when studying COMPLETELY depends on the person! Rock and roll might work for one person, while it might be distracting for another. Just let people do their thing)"

ToxicAMWF,GotTheseChansShook,Why do so many Asians say anime characters look Japanese? Are thy blind?," A lot look european, not all but a shit ton do. The vast majority of anime characters however don‚Äôt look Japanese. Anyone with eyes can see this."
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Weaboo Claims The Only Reason Plastic-Surgery Kpop Star Is Attractive Is Because He ""Looks White"" #AsianMansBestAlly"," That‚Äôs why whites like it in the first place, cause it appeals their white superiority complex. It‚Äôs the same reason why anime was able to achieve the popularity it did amongst europeens. Even the most japaphile whites deep down believe anime characters look white. If anime and kpop singers had more of an authentic traditional ethnic look to them, would they have blown up? I mean double eyelid surgery was invented by a white surgeon to make the eyes of korean sex workers more palatable to white American soldiers stationed in South Korea."

ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,r/Hapas Gets Called Out For Anti-Black And Anti-Blasian Racism For The MILLIONTH Time," After watching   for a long time, I think you‚Äôre right, but how did you arrive at those numbers? Any metrics? Or just anecdotal?"
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Girl FREAKS Out Bc Chinese Men Are ""Always Hitting On"" Her. ""EW"", She Said. #AsianMansBestAlly"," Right. And this is the realization they should come to, that 1) white girls aren't worth the pursue when they subconsciously think less of AM and 2) non-white girls would be more vocal if they don't want AM but that's a way smaller subset of the population and many non-white girls would love to have a relationship with AM. They also have no one to blame but themselves, when their self-imposed solutions seem to be activities that value eurocentric standards of ""masculinity"", that are treasured by basic beckys and karens: Earn more money. Dress in more expensive clothing. Workout to the nth degree to flash muscles. These goals aren't inherently bad to achieve if it stems from a real desire to improve oneself, but I only hear Chans stating these goals with the ultimate purpose of getting more white girls' attention."
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,r/Hapas Gets Called Out For Anti-Black And Anti-Blasian Racism For The MILLIONTH Time," It‚Äôs way higher than that, lmfao."
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,r/Hapas Gets Called Out For Anti-Black And Anti-Blasian Racism For The MILLIONTH Time, Yeah but Chans want to know the AMWF stats during that genocide first to see if there really was any ‚Äúracism‚Äù there. 
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Weaboo Claims The Only Reason Plastic-Surgery Kpop Star Is Attractive Is Because He ""Looks White"" #AsianMansBestAlly"," I was also considering the Asian girls who worship white features, but I see your point. I could have taken the extra second to write out ""whities and AF (and possibly a small subset of Black girls and Latinas due to probabilities and the fan base being so large)"".  One of my goals for 2019 is to unapologetically call things out like I see it, and this could've been an opportunity. Thanks."
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Girl FREAKS Out Bc Chinese Men Are ""Always Hitting On"" Her.

ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Weaboo Claims The Only Reason Plastic-Surgery Kpop Star Is Attractive Is Because He ""Looks White"" #AsianMansBestAlly"," Wrong. The entire premise of this thread is about a WHITE koreaboo being racist, and you‚Äôre here trying to chanspain it to include all ‚Äúgirls‚Äù.  Lmfao. Do whites tell other whites to stop mentioning the race of non whites when non whites do something bad? Nope. And yet here you are, the typical white ass licking Chan ready to put a cape on for your white lord."
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Girl FREAKS Out Bc Chinese Men Are ""Always Hitting On"" Her. ""EW"", She Said. #AsianMansBestAlly"," I totally believe you. And I think more AM should be aware of this also. Most AM (especially the Chan) have bought into the mindset that they're undesirable, so they   that the options are not there. Until they break out of that mentality, they can't be honest with themselves that they also find non-white women just as gorgeous."
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Weaboo Claims The Only Reason Plastic-Surgery Kpop Star Is Attractive Is Because He ""Looks White"" #AsianMansBestAlly"," It's the default in THIS discussion.

ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"White Girl FREAKS Out Bc Chinese Men Are ""Always Hitting On"" Her. ""EW"", She Said. #AsianMansBestAlly"," Possibly! AM should keep an open mind and go for these women. There can be an advantage in broadening the horizon. But that also increases the risk of discrimination also, as we know that there are Lus and bananarangs out there.

atheism,Heinzelboss,About Bidens speech: Why is America so religion-centered?," Because we've swerved ever-more Christian since the cold war. Tell enough people that believing in something can solve all their fears and problems and... Well, you get Trump and his followers.  The faithful. The people who take everything on word and will not verify anything. The people to who the President saying ""everything's fine"" is enough. The people who believe so vehemently in something and fear for their eternity so terribly that they would do anything to not burn in hell. It becomes very real and very terrible. There were times where I would think... I STILL think that some thing that I do might bring the lightning and the fall into eternal flame. Tell someone who believes in God that they must do something or burn forever and they will do everything against their best interests because here doesn't matter. Here is transient. You're an immortal soul drifting temporarily through this world and it leaves you detached. Drifting through a sea of Christians you will see again, sinners you will not, and no end to judgement. Parent died? They're still watching you. Don't fuck up. God is watching. Your father is watching. Your grandfather is watching. Authority is watching. Don't slip up. One wrong move and it's eternal flame. Do everything I say and you'll be in the kingdom of heaven come the end. Comply. Otherwise, burn. It's been gnawing at our country since it's founding and has only made itself all but the established religion over time. It isn't as if God didn't make it into the constitution. It's not a surprise that religion has remained latched to the country and only tightened it's grip to the point that most would call it a Christian nation and, by population, they'd likely be right. It's just the power of fear. Create the disease then sell the cure. Offer people obedience and paradise or disobedience and hellfire... Well... Even the skeptics might do what you say.

And even then, the attraction is in being a meathead or a soft sissy. We didn't shatter the stereotype, but merely morphed into another. I can see that. As an industry that's all about impression management, they have to have been aware of the optics on some level.  Tangentially, there's been many pop stars in Asia that tried to penetrate the American media market, but didn't play into being a Flower Boy and flexed in their own way (Chow Young Fat and Jay Chou come to mind).

The quests are definitely worse than their older games, but between the quests being ok and the absolute volume of quests that are available to the player, there's always something different to do in the game.

But I think this gif was well-received because it's the rare instance where an AM is not put down for the sake of comedy, and it's representation that messages how AM can be a desirable partner in an interracial relationship.

My freshman year of college i took a class where one massive project was just my entire grade. We were all working insane hours in the week leading up to the due date. Some people just slept in the studio. Some skipped other classes. It was pretty insane. I've had other classes where the professor would come by at 2am to see who was there working and who wasn't. Our building was the only one opened 24 hours a day because there was an expectation that we would be there at all hours. I'm sure it varies somewhat by school, but some majors just have this pervasive attitude that if you arent half sick by how much you're working, then you arent working enough. If it's not consuming your life, then you arent doing it right.  It's completely unhealthy and pretty fucked up. In a weird sort of way, it was the most worst fun i had. There's a kind of camaraderie you have when you're all doing something insane together.  But also I knew more than one student who were just totally broken by it.

unpopularopinion,ILovePizzasDoYou,Replaying an older game is way better than playing the newest game out there.," Cuphead is a game I occasionally come back to time to time.
Funny story: first time I saw Cuphead was when my friend told me about it. He jokingly said it was an easy game, but with an amazing story.
I believed him (cuz o never heard of Cuphead before) and searched it on steam.
What I saw was a cartoony game. My mind subconsciously though that cartoon is linked with children and subconsciously thought Cuphead was a kids game. The 3+ ESRB rating only reinforced that idea.
So I started the game and thought: ‚Äúgambling with the devil? Interesting story‚Äù I skipped the tutorial thinking it was gonna be easy AF and went to the first boss.
I didn‚Äôt even get past its first phase.
Now today I‚Äôve beat the game and have 40 hours in the game. Whenever I feel in a good mood I go and play Cuphead again to remind myself that I suck."

atheism,chevyfried,A rebuttal: 12 Step Programs are religious pseudo-science rather than clinically-proven interventions for addictions," Yes, and AA is becoming less rigid when it comes to spirituality, depending on the group of course.  The fact that it's free and every group has members with a lot of sober time gives it a certain shine.  Where I live there are long term AA members who are athiest or agnostic and don't mind sharing that fact.  One thing that is agreed on is that alcoholism recovery has a low success rate regardless of the method.  I take what I need from AA and leave the rest behind, and I also see health professionals and have been through a cognitive outpatient program.  Addiction is a real bitch and I'll take all the help I can get."

atheism,dreamdiode,12 Step Programs are religious pseudo-science rather than clinically-proven interventions for addictions," That's kind of the beauty of it, you can interpret them in different ways but get the same result. There's an older generation that doesn't want to move on it, but there have been revisions to the big book to modernize it over the years. The problem is, for some people they idolize the steps and refuse change because it helped them but don't do the critical thinking to understand why it did.  It was written in 1935 for the most severe of alcoholics that couldn't get help. Bill and Dr. Bob found something that worked for them and it was the only thing that worked for a lot of people. Medicine and psychology just weren't able to help yet, and for some people it is the only way to stay sober still. There's a pervasive thought that officially changing things may hurt others potential sobriety in the future.  Honestly I thought it was all christian bullshit when I saw God in the steps too, but then the meeting turned out to be in a synogogue so that put me at ease lol. Also FUCK the people that start/end meetings with christian prayers. The serenity prayer works for me because its more like a montra in my mind. Going through the steps helped get me sober along with support from my friends and family. Step 4/5 + 8/9 really were life changing. It was a whole different experience talking about my life with a sponsor instead of a therapist, there's something about talking to someone who has been through similar shit and isn't being paid that makes it more real. That and making amends took so much stress off, I hadn't even realized how much regret I had in the back of my mind."

I'm a Christian but I have a very hard time agreeing with the ""hardcore Christian conservatives"" you are referring to. The Trump presidency is one area where I think they may be right but for vastly different reasons than most of them claim. I believe the last four years exposed a lot of problems, hate, and division in this country. None of that can be corrected until it is exposed and accepted as reality. It could be argued that many of these ""Christians"" are at the very root of some of these problems. In fact, I would say they are at times the worst offenders. Even so, while they may not want to admit it, I believe God allowed Trump in office to expose a lot of this hypocrisy.  In short, no one, including God, likes a hateful ""Christian."" Their real enemy isn't Democrats or Progressives or Leftists. Their real problem is in the mirror and most of them refuse to admit it."

leagueoflegends,garuraa,This sounds weird but Legends of Runeterra feels more like League of Legends than League of Legends.," DJ Sona is canon in Pentakill because in an Ask Riot: Pentakill edition where the QA was done from the members' perspectives, Kathus confirmed knowledge of her doing another gig. For whether K/DA and Pentakill exists in the same universe, this is acknowledged by both that Evelynn titbit and the posters for both Pentakill and DJ Sona being plastered in both Seraphine's room and the Popstars music video, and with the tech of DJ Sona, K/DA is very much possible in the same timeline.  At this point you're being very pedantic to try and not seem wrong, but let's say that K/DA exists on earth and not Runeterra. Would you then be fine if we took Pentakill, which is confirmed to exist on Runeterra as a card set? And if you do accept it, why should we accept one skin set over another? Because the ""world"" doesn't have the same name? And maybe you think no skinline should be a part of LoR, why should they limit their storytelling potential then? Highnoon, Project and SG seem to have a very compelling setting and lore from what has been seen, why should we wait for a brand new skin before we get new lore for them instead of getting more lore through the card content of LoR? Refusing to add skinline sets reduces the design space, stifles creativity and also wastes the potential that these AU can provide."

I do think healthy and happy AMWF relationships are possible (or they could at least be just as functional as any other pairings), but such AMWFs, in my opinion, would not bother trying to   their pairings. They would just do their own thing and keep to themselves. And, at best, the WF would avoid invalidating any of the AM's plight. "
ToxicAMWF,toxicAMWF,"r/ESR Calls To ""Shun"" Hapas: Only The WMAF Ones Though, Lol"," They can if they promise to give up their life's salary, their arms and legs and their dignity for her LOL. But in all seriousness, it really depends on the WF. Unfortunately, WF's are the buyers in the dating/marriage market with AM's, because there are so many AM's salivating like dogs wishing for just one mediocre WF to throw them a bone and pay attention to them. And yes, I include MARRIAGE too. They are THAT white-worshipping. Which really says something, because WF's make up such a huge part of the female pool in the Western dating market, while AM's represent such a small percentage in the male pool, so if anything, just based on numbers and if everything was ""normal"", AM's should actually have their pick of the litter and be able to snag the best-looking, most accomplished, most high-status WF's. But that's not the case. All over the Internet you see AM's asking questions about how to get WF's, PUA artists selling strategies on how to get WF's, pro-AMWF sites like AznIdentity and more. Which really tells you how little WF's as a general whole actually think of AM's, despite all the harping in these AM subs about how pro-AM WF's are and how much better they are LOL. And even if they do manage to get a WF, chances are they're either koreaboos/weaboos (who I personally don't have anything against, as long as they don't shit on AF's, other WOC's, or the Asian community as a whole), OR they're bitter and insecure WF's who went to AM's as a second choice to say ""fuck you"" to WM's that rejected them in their youth and make themselves feel better by putting down and ""taking away men"" from AF's, who they often view as competition. The latter type of WF, especially, are quite nasty to deal with. I tend to notice a lot of these WF's who date AM's only recognize anti-Asian racism on a very superficial level and will do so publicly only if it makes them look like one of the ""good"" white people. But the moment you bring up truths about the white community that makes them uncomfortable, or even worse, make unsavory comments about WF's, that's when they shut down, unsheath their claws and turn on you. They start hurling insults calling people reverse racists, gaslighting them, calling them sexist, and basically doing anything to not take responsibility for themselves or their own group for the wrongdoings they do, even if it is a true generalized statement. The most hilarious example of this is the actual AMWF subs full of WF's and AM's in AMWF relationships. I've seen AM's go in asking why they have so much difficulty dating WF's and asking the WF's in there whether it could be because a lot of WF's just don't find AM's attractive. Pretty benign question, right? And how do these supposedly pro-AM WFs respond? These girls come pouncing in reprimanding the AM for accusing WF's of racism, that WF's   are not racist towards AM's in dating (that is a blatant lie), that the AM is sexist for feeling entitled to WF's, and gaslighting the AM saying that it's all in his head, it's his fault and he needs to self-improve to be worthy of a WF. The AM's that go looking for AMWF relationships in the first place are already white-worshipping, self-hating Chans, so a lot of them don't have the balls to go and talk back to these WFs, and they end up rolling over, and blame themselves for their dating problems as suggested by these WF's. These AMWF relationships can't be all that happy, because the second most outspoken type of men on AznIdentity and these pro-AM subs are AM's in AMWF relationships, with single/incel Asian men being the most outspoken. AznIdentity and these pro-AM spaces are not places for the faint of heart, and it deals with a lot of very real and serious problems that AM's face, and to a lesser extent, the Asian community faces. Topics like childhood trauma, fear of state and individual violence from WM's, gendered racism affecting dating/career/political representation etc., the abandonment of AM's by an abnormally large portion of AF's for WM's, and anti-AM/Asian propaganda are all not light topics. So in general, it's a pretty gloomy and miserable place. Happy and fulfilled people who feel good in their lives don't go looking for a place like this, much less participate in it. The ones who come to these places are generally people who desperately want to talk about these issues, but aren't having their needs met IRL by the people close to them, so they come to an anonymous forum like this, and do things that take up way too much time for an ordinary person to bother with, like writing multiple posts a day for months or even years on end, lending their time and energy to write referenced essays/articles, compile statistical studies, write full-on guides on how to get women, etc. ALL using their own time and for free. The AM participants in AMWF relationships are always some of the most emotionally charged, outspoken, and committed posters too, and if they're putting all this effort in to talk about these issues on a freaking anonymous Internet forum despite having a supposedly loyal and pro-AM WF partner that should be able to talk about deep and concerning issues with their AM partners,   And given how WF's are as a general whole when it comes to topics like racism and based on examples like the one I mentioned above, it honestly isn't surprising that these supposedly successful, educated, ""alpha"" AM's have resorted to this. And if you really want to see how miserable these AM's are, compare the behaviors of these AM's in AMWF relationships with the AM participants who are in long-term relationships/marriages with AF's, and you can see the difference immediately. The AM's with AF's in general are a lot more calm, measured, and more analytical about the problems of the Asian community, and less emotionally volatile like the single AM's and the AM's in AMWF relationships, despite the fact that they are with ""AF's who are all bananarangs and who can't relate to AM's like pro-AM WF's."" Sure, some may be ""Channed out"", as some of these pro-AMWF people may accuse them of being. But it's more likely that these AM's in AMAF relationships are simply getting their needs met IRL by their AF partners with regards to having meaningful conversations about these types of issues that, apparently, WF's won't or aren't able to have, so there's less of a need for these types of AM's to go all out in these forums. After all, while AF's are not AM's, they're still Asian, and there's definitely common ground that the two groups can find that a WF probably can't. I'd also say the same could apply with non-white, non-Asian XF's when it comes to dealing with general experiences of racism by whites. From my perspective, these AM participants in AMWF sound utterly miserable. It seems the only way you can be happy as an AM in AMWF is to be completely brainwashed, disown your loyalty to your Asian heritage/Asian community, and never care about the racism that's inflicted your way, even by your own WF partner. Otherwise, you will just end up repressed and miserable pretending that you have no problems with your WF wife while you toil away at night on your computer in an anonymous Internet forum with other unhappy AM's."

I guarantee a lot of students in my generation can say the same, whether they want to admit it or not.  One of the issues is that it‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy. If you just slog through the day because you can and you‚Äôre not fully mindful of what you‚Äôre doing and your mind is 100% focused, you‚Äôre going to think that you‚Äôre more overworked than you are, you‚Äôre going to be more easily exhausted, and your mind isn‚Äôt going to be sharp. Then your diet and sleep is going to be poor, and that will perpetuate the cycle.

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," It‚Äôs only more difficult in the sense that it can be harder to study how a non-human moves. If needed, it‚Äôs also more difficult to mocap to ‚Äúcheat.‚Äù However, there‚Äôs nothing inherently more difficult in creating nonhuman animations, and in fact it can be a boon, because humans are SUPER perceptive of how we ourselves move. We will be extremely judgemental if a human doesn‚Äôt move how we expect it to. (Look at the Seraphine animation complaints.) As opposed to say, Hecarim, who doesn‚Äôt actually really move like a horse but we accept it because it doesn‚Äôt trigger our uncanny valley sense.  Nonhumans have a lot more leeway in how far off from reality you can make their animations, than you do with a human. In this sense, they are easier. How inherently difficult animation is though is mostly just attributable to the art team‚Äôs personal experience in animation. This is a part of the reason why traditions animation favored funny animals, actually. Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunney, etc. You can do some funky things with squash/stretch without it looking like a deformed monstrosity. There has always been humans in animation ofc, but it can be a lot more difficult to land right.  Theoretically if your entire roster consists of humans, you COULD share animations/rigs... but Riot seems to individually handcraft all of their champion rigs anyways so that‚Äôs a bit moot.

ToxicAMWF,,Theory: The Decline of the Value of the WF in the Future and their Backlash Against Non-White XF's Rising Status - Possible Major Shifts in the Female Dating/Desirability Landscape," I also want to address the AM's and MOC's that lurk here. Specifically, the reason why a lot of them are so adamant on pushing AMWF and other XMWF is based on the assumption that the presence of a WF on their arm will perform two functions: If WF's no longer have that high status or recognition, and instead WOC's like BF's, LF's, IF's, MENAF's, and AF's were to suddenly rise in status and desirability, what would be the point of having a WF on one's arm and therefore, the promotion of AMWF or XMWF? If anything, the presence of an average-looking, less than impressive WF on one's arm when the AM or MOC is tall, handsome, established, and superior will not stir the jealousies of WOC's or WM's. If anything, it would lead to a mocking of the AM or MOC for being so pathetic and weird for punching below their weight. Obviously, if these couples happen organically with genuine love and respect for each other, these couples are for the most part alright. The problem is, based on what I'm seeing from AM and MOC spaces, a huge portion for this avid push for the desirability of WF's is predicated more on the high status that WF's have been afforded in society, and less to do with a measured assessment of women for potentially good partners, despite the claim of ""all AMXF"".  But no matter the case, the expected course for the status of WF's will be to inevitably decrease while the status for WOC will be expected to rise, if the trends stated above continue to persist. While the WF's with AM's and MOC's who genuinely love them do not need to worry, I worry more for the WF's who've become heavily involved with AM's and MOC's who were motivated to pursue them in part by their (now decreasing) high social status."

unpopularopinion,OMPOmega,"Jail/Prison should be only for violent criminals (including sex offenders). Everyone else can be fined, put under house arrest, or put under modified house arrest."," Because I believe everyone would be dead in that situation. A situation of publicly caning someone as I suggested gives people a second chance.  They would not lose years of their life.  It would not cost the courts and community excessive amounts of money and if done correctly I guarantee the person who gets whipped would not want to do whatever they did again.  Atleast not without thinking about it.  Sure they would have a scar..maybe.  It really depends how hard they are lashed.  But, they would walk away..maybe after some time in the hospital.  But, they would still walk away and get another chance at the world. If you just execute people for literally anything and everything as you are suggesting then I believe everyone would be dead.  Because, I am sure everyone has committed a couple infractions or crossed the line here or there. As far as prisons go the assumption is you are supposed to be suffering a bit.  I understand  the mentality that everyone is a human being and so they should be treated to a certain level.  But, even the way prisons are now, atleast in the US, I have come across a couple people that actually preferred prison.  I worked with a guy that people just said was institutionalized.  He did a stretch and while he was in the halfway house he was working at the same place I worked.  A few days before he was supposed to be released he skipped out of the halfway house and stole a car just to get arrested again.  He needed the structure.  So, if you make prisons to accommodating people will just call it home sweet home.   That being said I think it is another point for Public canings.  As long as it can be resolved with a public caning people wouldn't need to go to prison for low level stuff they would just get caned  and then people would never get a chance to be institutionalized.  Then in that case I guess prisons could be better because the only people who would be in them would be people sitting on deathrow ( because in my mind you can not just kill them they have to have a few years to see if they can fight the case or prove their innocents) or lifers.

If you‚Äôve figured out how to live this great healthy lifestyle, that‚Äôs awesome, be proud. But for a lot of us it‚Äôs very difficult, and sometimes it helps to not have to pretend like we‚Äôve figured it out. If we talk about how little sleep we got, and someone can relate, then it feels like maybe it‚Äôs not so bad that I don‚Äôt have my shit together sometimes. I work very hard but my mental state is not the greatest, and ADHD makes things like homework very difficult. 
It sounds like right now you‚Äôre frustrated that others are faking having an unhealthy lifestyle just for bragging rights, and some people do that, but for a lot of us it‚Äôs genuine difficultly keeping up.

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," The point with some of these games isn't just monster specific. A character that is ugly/unconventional/non human can be just as popular as a character that isn't with a good kit The point with overwatch is the most popular characters aren't popular because people find them attractive but because they are fun or just good. That's why the only conventionally attractive character in the top 5 is mercy. Hots has half of top 10 as non human Smash ultimate has 18 million copies sold it definitely is not niche or old.  Of course it's always easier throw your good kits on cute girls and call it a day but when does it become oversaturated? Where is the creativity? Even the best selling gatcha game fgo doesn't rely strictly on cycling between cute girl, cute guy to make all of it's sales and the fact that I see more monsters and unconventional things in a game that relies ENTIRELY on character design and gambling is sad."

leagueoflegends,ky4ntran,how do people do so much damage?," You can replay tutorials from PLAY > training > tutorial, or the practice tool, which is usually used to test things, but can also let you set up a 1v1 bot game with cheats to mess around in. The tutorial will just show you the bare basics of how to move, attack, buy items.  is the sub dedicated to teaching players of all skill levels, and should have some good guides.

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," All of the champs on this list are consistently strong, and often older picks. All a lot of the top 20 list says about champ popularity, is that it‚Äôs safe to main them, because riot probably won‚Äôt gut them anytime soon. Of the ones that haven‚Äôt been recently consistent, they‚Äôre either high outplay (Akali) or new (Seraphine). Many of these are proplay staples as well, and people love to play proplay popular picks, even if they‚Äôre on the weaker side outside of a professional setting.  The thing that you are missing, which this thread is dedicated to pointing out, is that there are MANY factors to a champion‚Äôs popularity, and being a human is NOT the only one. Having an outplay kit isn‚Äôt the only one. Having a simple kit isn‚Äôt the only one. The only thing we can know for sure, is that high PR champions are consistently good picks...something which very few monster champs can claim, since they often get experimental kits, leaving them open to being balance problems. Hence the assertion that, unless their popularity comes out of left field (like Yuumi), Riot has left monster champs doomed to fail, and thus are in a self-fulfilling prophecy."

leagueoflegends,pumbahusajo,Is there way to click Yuumi off of yourself?," The difference there can be attributed to an expectation being broken. To be good with Yuumi you do need to know when to detach and how to utilize your passive. The skill expression that is there is absolutely minimal because she lacks the vulnerability that other champs all have to deal with.  Yuumi is entirely reliant on the adc playing the lane safe, and the enemy team not abusing the early game weaknesses of your bot lane. Yuumi is there to help with whatever the team needs, and might make everything that a team does slightly better, but she isn't the one ultimately making those decisions because she is a complete follower.  She is the least skill expressive champion in the game. In no way do I ever feel like Yuumi outplays an opponent or gets outplayed. She either has a good strong team, or her team is weak. She can buff up a strong team to push them over the edge but she can never turn around a weaker team's fortunes with a big outplay. Even in laning phase, she is relying on the enemy team not abusing her early game weaknesses.  At least with Janna, Garen, Sona or some other easy champions, they have clear windows of weakness and opportunities to express skill. Sona is the squishiest champion in the game, and is very weak early. Her ult is a huge playmaking ability. The utility of Janna can be incredibly skillful. Timing her q and her r properly can make for some great plays. We saw Adrian do this for IMT back in the day. Garen likewise can at least show game knowledge with how he trades and farms, especially with his positioning in lane. Yuumi has nothing compared to even these champions. You will never see her make ""The Penta"" even if she is strong simply because whatever she does is to the credit of her allies."

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," It doesn‚Äôt have to be a lie. Riot is an American company, and due to our shareholder laws, marketers and financial advisors will have more power and say in a creative decision than the actual creatives. If the data Riot has is faulty (which is probably is, due to how Riot creates monster kits), the financial advisors can‚Äôt and will never make any decision except based on what the data says, which impacts the creative process. And it is extremely unprofessional to say ‚Äúyeah we wanted X, but our financial advisor told us the data says Y will sell better,‚Äù so they will just explain what their current data tells them.  Nevermind all the other factors that impact monster champ popularity. I expect that a 2021 champ will be a cute Disney critter due to Yuumi‚Äôs success, and riot may be able to use this to follow up with more nonhumans in the future. But it‚Äôs a very slow process and ultimately, the actual game developers have less say over the development of a game than the financial advisors."

And to be sure I have no respect for people who do use paddles or rods to hit their children with. Back in middle school I had this history teacher who at the beginning of the year pointed out how he had a big wooden paddle with half a dozen holes in it that he'd threaten to use on anyone who he sent to the office.

atheism,Highontires,Here‚Äôs what the hardcore Christian conservatives are saying (this is from the son of an old classmate), Secularism doesn't equal immoral. A secular federal government insures that citizens have the liberty to decide for themselves what they consider moral. A secular federal government actually increases religious liberty because it insures that the religious (non religious) person can exercise his moral conscience without the fear of the government taking legal action against him. The whole point of the Bill of Rights is to protect a citizen's freedom from the government. Your Christian friend doesn't want this level of freedom. In fact he fears that level of freedom because a nation that free completely eliminates his power and control over others.

unpopularopinion,-momi,"The steoreotype of ""student running on four hours of sleep and a package of instant ramen"" is not cool and damaging to student mental health"," If I may offer some additional support to your statement. I should also note that this is in no way me bragging about my time at college, but more so a warning of what can happen. I was homeschooled my entire life, and was the first of 4 generations to actually go to college. I had no job/income when I started going to school, and I lived in a completely different city. I had to take a ferry to get to school and so, I had to wake up at 4am to make the first ferry at 6am, just so that I could make it to school. I had to walk all the way to the ferry, (multiple miles), then once I landed in Seattle, I had to walk even further to actually get to the school by 8am. Since I didn‚Äôt have a computer at home, (couldn‚Äôt afford one), I had to do all my schoolwork on campus. Generally I was at the school from open to close, so from 8am to 11pm, just so I could finish my assignments. Since I didn‚Äôt have a job/income of any kind, my budget for food was nonexistent. I was only able to afford eating once every 3-4 days, and sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt eat for a full week. By the time I got home, usually it was about 2am, so I would only get maybe 2 hours of sleep during the week. All of these factors added up and eventually I had to go into the er to have my gallbladder removed. I was exhausted, starving and had my gallbladder poisoning me for about 8 months during my first year. I almost died because I was pushing myself too hard. In my second year, I moved into Seattle and got a job with the school, at its library. With a couple of those hardships alleviated, my health took another turn for the worse, and this time I had to leave the school cause my attendance was taking a hit. I haven‚Äôt been able to go back and finish, and now I‚Äôm permanently disabled. Because of all the strain I put on my body, I can barely walk, and the amount of pain I used to be in has tripled. So every day is a fight to stand up and even walk to the main area to be with family. Again, this is in no way meant to be me ‚Äúbragging‚Äù about what I went through, more so it is meant to be a warning. Focus on your health and well-being so that you can finish your education and not be burned out at the end. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves, be it emotionally, mentally or physically. Your health takes precedence, even over your family and friends. Please be safe and take care of yourself."

Instead I highly suggest you gift your kid a name that is unique, or unique enough that not many people share that same name.

If anything, you have a very high chance to ban out something your opponent actually plays. Sure, in mid I ban leblanc and I ban katarina whenever I'm duo with someone playing bot, you could say those are good bans because they're much more difficult to deal with than a yasuo. But what are the chances any of my opponents even play lb or kat? If they don't, which is most of the time, my ban was pointless anyway. It's why I ban Darius in toplane as Kayle. It's not an unwinnable matchup, but it's an extremely popular and annoying champion who you have to play 10x better against than he does in lane if you want to even have a chance.

Republicans are trying to remove anti-discrimination laws, and fought hard against the legalization of gay marriage, just to name a few things. 2) The Republican party (Not Trump specifically, not sure why you are focusing on him when I never mentioned him in my comment) has been primarily responsible for things like redlining that have kept cities segregated. Then they put a high police presence in minority neighborhoods, which combined with draconian drug laws means that minorities are arrested at a much higher rate (and with much higher sentences for the same crimes) Republicans have also used gerrymandering and voter suppression to reduce the abilities of minorities to vote them out.  3) So, basically what you're saying is that you ""want people to have good healthcare"" but you don't want anyone to do anything about it. I don't know if you have some genius plan of your own, but the Republican party's plan is to just have repeal Obamacare and just leave it up to private insurance companies, which does NOT result in affordable healthcare, and means lots of people end up going bankrupt and/or dying. ¬† Also, in regard to Trump, I don't know if I would call losing a trade war, abandoning allies, drone striking a foreign military general in an international airport, etc. ""excellent foreign policy""."

unpopularopinion,hemlock_hangover,You need to get out of YOUR bubble or echo-chamber and SEEK OUT opposing views in order to understand them.," From an investment point of view, and as someone who has a 401k, I can see your point. Investors just won't invest if they don't get a dividend or some form of return.  But my argument about drug pricing is this. Say you synthesized a drug, know what you need, secured suppliers and made the initial investment in raw materials and machines to stamp ""pills"", measure and weigh ingredients or what have you. Now, the product is on initial rollout, you base pricing as a company to get a return on your investment in drug making infrastructure that you invested in. 5 years later, you've been paid back all your investment in the infrastructure and now your profits are growing even more because your ""debt"" for infrastructure is paid off. You also invest in doctors and people who are licensed to prescribe your medicine and have them promote and prescribe your product that you haven't R&D or tweaked since inception many many years ago and your infrastructure is still going strong factory wise. You aggressively drive down supplier cost of raw materials because your simply buying more or have another company dying to get in on the business so they underbid on a few projects of yours to  ""hopefully"" secure a second round of business after your 1-4 year contract is up.  Now as you get more and more doctors prescribing your meds, with same the infrastructure you long paid for and with an increasing demand for raw goods you are gaining a strong bargaining hand against potential suppliers with locking in massive quantity contracts with guaranteed payouts for X amount, they take the contracts for because it's a guaranteed sum, albeit small over a few years but you as the manufacturer are making even more with this cost crunching from suppliers while you steadily increase cost to the consumer.   Sorry for the run on ""paragraph"". But as I see it the company makes a ton while scrapping more from the consumer yet the consumer barely sees a pay raise. And I use my infrastructure analogy as how I see it from where I work, the auto manufacturing industry. The 15 dollar an hour is another argument, but I believe we can better than 7.25 an hour as mandated minimum wage. 60 years ago you could buy a house on 3 years income but the average American is way out of the income gap range to home ownership as it was back then."

leagueoflegends,JaqeyWasTaken,How the hell is Samira's 60% banrate okay?, Because Riot has made it very clear that they dont give a single fuck about actually making a playable game and instead just a vessel to sell skins. The balance team only exists to buff characters who are about to get skins (to sell the skins better) and the to keep the broken new champs broken until they get 1-2 extra skins and then nerf them into the ground. TLDR: Samira won't get nerfed until after her next skin
leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," That's is just not true For example, you put Azir as an example of a champ that is super flashy and looks great, therefore that champ should have like what, 7%? 10%? of pick rate? Welp, he have 0.6% of pickrate in the midlane, how low is that? well, lower than Maokai Support, in fact, maokai support almost double his pick rate (1.1%) Another example, Ornn has been like what, the best toplaner in the game for 3 years? Since release basically, and the kit is super cool to use too, and easy to learn. 2.9% of pick rate, he is picked as much as Vi jungler, an old champ, outdated and super offmeta and pretty fucking useless. Well, look at Volibear, he was played in worlds because he is kind of broken, and looks cool, have a super nice kit, kind of super power fantasy. He has to be more picked than the last 2 right? 2.2%, as much as Jax Jungler, an offmeta champ, and of course less than Ornn Now, look at the first top 20 most picked champ, 5% pick rate or more: 1.- Jhin 2.- Ezreal 3.- Ashe 4.- Caitlyn 5.- Kai'sa 6.- Miss Fortune 7.- Lee Sin 8.- Leona 9.- Yasuo 10.- Kayn 11.- Lux 12.- Graves 13.- Thresh 14.- Zed 15.- Morgana 16.- Samira 17.- Seraphine 18.- Akali 19.- Garen 20.- Yone Out of those 20, 6 champs have outplay potential, the other 14 are normal kits with no special shit going on. Win rate? Every champ 50¬±1%, except Akali and Lee, who are at 46, and Jhin, who is at 52. Then, why are people picking them? BECAUSE THEY ARE FUCKING HUMAN WITH THE MOST BASIC THEME POSSIBLE. That's the fucking problem, people are loud with this, they DONT WANT MONSTER, they only want to play boring humans, and nothing else. Why people are so stubborn to understand that monster are just not liked by people, and you can put the most flashy outplay super mechanical potential shit on those champ, and NOONE will play it, the only exception is Thresh, and is it an exception when he looks like human? i dont think so. Just fucking deal with it jesus, Riot wants to make money, and they dont want to lose money making a champ that no one will play..."

leagueoflegends,JaqeyWasTaken,How the hell is Samira's 60% banrate okay?,"  like unbalanced shit. Riot Mortdog made a really good point on a recent stream of his - somebody said that set 2 of TFT was the most balanced it had ever been, and asked why they couldn't balance the game like that anymore, and he responded by saying that yes, set 2 was the most balanced TFT had ever been, but it was so balanced it almost killed TFT off for good, and that unbalance in both TFT and League significantly increases overall player enjoyment and retention."

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," Well since you brought up Overwatch, it's not really exceptional. Pretty much all the characters are humans. The only thing I find surprising is that D.Va is so low, she seems like a prime pick for a character that would be really popular, but I think it be explained by the fact that her popularity diminishes as elo increases. Ana and Mercy also top the charts as female support characters, which isn't surprising, Genji the edgy ninja is the top offense character, and Reinhardt the giant tank guy is the top defense character, so pretty normal. IDK much about HotS but it's what I'd expect, D.Va, something with a broken winrate, and some edgy blood elf guy at the top. Everything in Rainbow 6 is a human and aesthetic matters less IMO because it's first person. Smash is too niche, too unsupported, and too old to matter, I think everyone settled into the characters they like by this point. You'll find unconventional looking characters towards the top because there's always exceptions but it's a very noticeable trend that human, especially cute human, characters tend to be more popular. The best example I can think of KDA Akali permanently boosting Akali's playrates."

leagueoflegends,garuraa,This sounds weird but Legends of Runeterra feels more like League of Legends than League of Legends.," My point is that the themes come off more when you're limited in regions. A deck with Draven and Jinx isn't lore friendly, but when the cards are specific to their region, and your animations are limited to those available champs, you're limited to 2 regions during your game experience. Maybe not for everyone, but some people will feel more immersed to the League world in LoR than in LoL. LoL where you can play with anyone, and you're focused more on abilities, minion, and objectives. Then there's also skins that change those themes even more."

leagueoflegends,Colton147147,Some reasonable buffs to make Karthus viable mid without breaking him," op is known troll btw. Although I'm curious to see if he flips his flair from ornn to karthus which he's been doing recently to really put some effort into his troll posts. Also TIL that karthus has 450 auto range. Why is it that comically low? Like that's below 'balance reasons', that's just 'fuck this champion in particular'. It wasn't even nerfed to 450 at some point, riot just straight up released him with 450 range and have let it ride since."

leagueoflegends,qwstrfg,The new health bar display of how much health someone is going to gain is more confusing than helpful and should not have been added," Ok i have never in my life thought to myself ""i wish i knew how much that guy will heal"". Yes it is terribly executed but i also dont think there is a way to clearly show it without totally cluttering the healthbar unless you make it like a completely different color. Good luck telling how much HP vlad has especially when he also gets shielded. If you wanna make it a feature for new players, i guess, go ahead. But then at least give us the option to turn it off."

leagueoflegends,Sharjo,Riot's Design Philosophy on Monster Champions Makes Me Sad," Is overwatch and exception too? The most popular characters are ana and zarya. Roadhog and moira are also popular.  How about HotS? It also has ugly/unconventional characters that are towards the top popularity wise.  Pathfinder was one of the most popular characters in apex for a while just barely under wraith in apex. Cthutlu is the second most popular character in smite at the moment. Ace is number 3 in rainbow 6 Ganon is one of the most popular characters online in smash Look at any hero based game and you can find unconventional looking characters towards the top if they are fun because once people get passed being new they will just play what is fun. It's more of a china thing than an everyone thing. If a cool champ isn't fun people won't stick with them. Riot has said this themselves with nocturne, and how he is very popular with new players at first but gets dropped super quick"

leagueoflegends,PKAYBeam,Jacob Wolf: PowerOfEvil will be a free agent ahead of the 2021 season, are TSM's finances bad or are they just really frugal compared to other NA orgs?
leagueoflegends,Jorielandleo,More ugly champions to contrast cute ones," Notice how none of your appealing fantasy has shit to do with the actual design of a character. Riot   shoots themselves in the foot with this. Every time they design a monstrous champ, their fantasy is that they're a monstrous champ. For some, this makes perfect sense. Maokai design can't   be some sort of treant fantasy. However, Riot has an   There are Vastaya in every region of Runeterra, and they're  . Anyone of them could have a fantasy that has nothing to do with the fact that they are Vastayan, but they could be Vastayan.  On top of that, many of them are designed with pretty niche kits. ASol is a world creating and ending force with near infinite power. He's also a dragon with a strange kit. Azir is a powerful emperor with legions at his finger tips. He's also a bird with a strange kit. Kindred is the embodiment and juror of death, choosing exactly when its someones time to die. They're also animals with a weird kit. The most popular Monster champs break away from both of these flaws. Kha'Zix is a stealthy predator who physically adapts over time. He's also a bug dude with a simple and fun kit. Most of the same goes for Rengar. Malphite is an unstoppable force who barrels through your team and takes hits like they're nothing. He's also a rock monster with a  simple and fun kit. It's not   that monster champs don't sell because they're not physically attractive, though that can be a part of it. It's that they're really not designed to sell."
